## About _murex_

_murex_ is a shell, like bash / zsh / fish / etc. It follows a similar syntax
to POSIX shells like Bash however supports more advanced features than you'd
typically expect from a $SHELL. A non-exhaustive list would include:

* Testing frameworks baked right into the language itself
* Smarter handling of errors (for example try/catch blocks, line numbers
  included in error messages, errors optionally highlighted in red, etc)
* Support for typed pipelines - which can be used to work with complex data
  formats like JSON natively. But also the ability to override or even ignore
  typed data entirely.
* Parses man pages for a richer user experience
* Optional support for event-driven programming
* Plus every aspect of the shell is easily extendable

The language employs a relatively simple syntax modelled loosely on functional
and stack-based programming paradigms (albeit without the LISP-style nested
parentheses that scare a lot of developers) while maintaining compatibility
with POSIX-like shells (eg Bash) wherever sensible. For example, a program
structure could look like the following:

    command | command | [ index ] | if { command }

However where _murex_ differs is that, while the pipe token, `|` is supported
for compatibility with existing shells, _murex_ idioms prefer `->` used for
readability as it clearly demonstrates the direction of the data flow. eg

    command -> command -> [ index ] -> if { command }

The language supports multiple data types natively; such as JSON, YAML,
CSV, S-Expressions, CSV and even loosely tabulated terminal output (eg
`ps`, `ls -l`, etc). This makes passing data through the pipeline and
parsing output easier when dealing with more complex arrangements of
data than a simple byte stream in traditional shells like Bash.

## Interactive shell

Aside the _murex_ being carefully designed with scripting in mind, the
interactive shell itself is also built around productivity. To achieve this,
we wrote our own readline library. Below is an example of that library in use:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/232714.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/232714)

The above demo includes the following features of _murex_'s bespoke readline
library:

* hint text - blue status text below the prompt (the colour is configurable)
* syntax highlighting (albeit there isn’t much syntax to highlight in the
  example). This can also be turned off if your preference is to have colours
  disabled
* tab-completion in gridded mode (seen when typing `cd`)
* tab-completion in list view (seen when selecting a process name to `kill`
  where the process ID was substituted when selected)
* regex searching through the tab-completion suggestions (seen in both `cd` and
  `kill` - enabled by pressing `[CTRL+f]`)
* line editing using $EDITOR (`vi` in the example - enabled by pressing `[ESC]`
  followed by `[v]`)
* readline’s warning before pasting multiple lines of data into the buffer and
  the preview option that’s available as part of the aforementioned warning
* and VIM keys (enabled by pressing `[ESC]`)

## Concise yet predictable

Despite the amount of features added to shell, we have tried to keep the
amount of "magic" to a minimum and follow a pretty standard structure so
the language is predictable. However there are times when a little magic
goes a long way. For example _murex_'s support for complex data objects
of differing formats is managed in the pipeline so you don't need to think
about the data format when querying data from them.

    open: file.csv -> [ column_name ] # returns specific columns (or rows) in CSV file
    open: file.json -> [ index ]      # returns specific items from JSON

The index function (`[`) alters its matching algorithm depending on the
piped data type and `open` sets the data type depending on the file
extension or MIME type.

Sometimes you will want fewer guesswork or just the robustness of a forced
behavior. On those occasions you can remove one layer of magic by
casting the data type:

    open: file.txt -> cast csv -> [ column_name ]
    open: file.txt -> cast json -> [ index ]

This awareness of data structures is also utilised in `foreach` (which
will cycle through each index in an array) and `formap` (key/value
iteration against complex objects). See [GUIDE.control-structures](docs/GUIDE.control-structures.md)
for more details on these and other control structures.

## More robust scripts / shell one liners

_murex_ employs a few methods to make shell scripting more robust:

Bash, for all it's power, is littered with hidden traps. We aim to
address as many of them as we can without taking the flexibility nor power
away from the intereactive command line. This is achieved through a couple
of key concepts:

### Everything is a function

The biggest breaking change from regular shells is how globbing isn't expanded
by the shell by default. This is instead done by inlining functions as arrays:

    # Bash
    ls -l *.go

    # Murex
    ls -l @{g *.go}

The advantage of _murex_'s method is that we can now offer other ways of
matching file system objects that follows the same idiomatic pattern:

    # Match files by regexp pattern
    ls -l @{rx \.go$}

    # Match only directories
    ls -l @{f +d}

(more information on `g`, `rx` and `f` are available in [GUIDE.quick-start](docs/GUIDE.quick-start.md)).

However there will be occasions when you just want an inlined expansion
(eg when using an interactive shell) and that can be achieved via the `@g`
command prefix:

    @g ls -l *.go

### Powerful autocompletion

_murex_ takes a slightly different approach to command line autocompletion,
both from a usability perspective as well as defining completion rules.

Inspired by IDEs, _murex_ queries man pages directly for flags as well as
"tooltip" descriptions. Custom completions are defined via JSON meaning
simple commands are much easier to define and complex commands can still
fallback to using dynamic shell code just like they are in other shells.

This makes it easier to write completion rules as well as making the code
more readable. An example of `git`s autocompletion definition:

    private git-branch {
        # returns git branches and removes the current one from the list
        git branch -> [ :0 ] -> !match *
    }

    autocomplete set git { [{
        # define the top level flags
        "Flags": [
            "clone", "init", "add", "mv", "reset", "rm", "bisect", "grep",
            "log", "show", "status", "branch", "checkout", "commit", "diff",
            "merge", "rebase", "tag", "fetch", "pull", "push", "stash"
        ],

        # specify what values those flags support
        "FlagValues": {
            "init": [{
                "Flags": [ "--bare" ]
            }],
            "add": [{
                "IncFiles": true,
                "AllowMultiple": true
            }],
            "mv": [{
                "IncFiles": true
            }],
            "rm": [{
                "IncFiles": true,
                "AllowMultiple": true
            }],
            "checkout": [{
                "Dynamic": ({ git-branch }),
                "Flags": [ "-b" ]
            }],
            "merge": [{
                "Dynamic": ({ git-branch })
            }]
        }
    }] }

_murex_ also supports several different styles of completion suggestion
"popups" to cater for different scenarios (demo above) as well as built in
support for jumping to files within nested directories quickly and easily:

    cat [ctrl+f]app.g[return]
    # same as typing: cat config/app.go

### Error handling

Like traditional shells, _murex_ is verbose with errors by default with
options to mute them. However _murex_ also supports cleaner decision
structures for when you want you want errors captured in a useful way:

    try {
        # do something
    }
    catch {
        err: "Could not perform action"
    }

As well as a saner `if` syntax:

    if { = `foo`==`bar` } then {
        out: "`foo` matched `bar`"
    }

    !if { foobar } else {
        err: "`foobar` could not be run"
    }

### Test and debugging frameworks

Unlike traditional shells, _murex_ is designed with a test and debugging modes
baked into the shell language. This means you can write tests against your
shell scripts as part of the shell scripts itself.

For example:

    func hello-world {
        test define example {
            "StdoutRegex": (^Hello World$)
        }

        out <test_example> "Hello Earth"
    }

    test run { hello-world }

...will output:

    Hello Earth
     Status  Definition Function                                           Line Col. Message
    [FAILED] example    out                                                5    9    stdout: regexp did not match 'Hello Earth'

If test mode isn't enabled then any `test` commands are skipped without being
executed so you can liberally include test cases throughout your functions
without worrying about any performance impact.

## Language guides

1. [GUIDE.syntax](https://murex.rocks/GUIDE.syntax.html) is recommended first
   as it gives an overview if the shell scripting languages syntax and data
   types.

2. [GUIDE.type-system](https://murex.rocks/GUIDE.type-system.html) describes
   _murex_'s type system. Most of the time you will not need to worry about
   typing in _murex_ as the shell is designed around productivity.

3. [GUIDE.builtin-functions](https://murex.rocks/GUIDE.builtin-functions.html)
   lists some of the builtin functions available for this shell.

Or if you're already a seasoned Bash developer then you read the Quick
Start Guide, [GUIDE.quick-start](https://murex.rocks/GUIDE.quick-start.html),
to jump straight into using _murex_.

## Install instructions

There are various ways you can load _murex_ on to your system. See [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) for details.

## CI/CD

_murex_ makes heavy use of testing and CI/CD to ensure the latest builds are
safe for use.

1. Git `pre-commit` and `pre-push` files exist to help developers catch any
   regression errors before they even hit the feature branches.

2. Each and every git push is validated against more than a thousand distinct
   unit tests in Circle CI. These tests are run 10 times to shake out any
   possible timing related bugs.

3. Weekly automated builds are then ran against the latest commit to the
   `master` branch. These builds run in AWS CodeBuild and they generate the
   [murex.rocks](https://murex.rocks) website as well a build pre-compiled
   binaries for [download](https://murex.rocks/DOWNLOAD.html).
