    ## Description

    Terminology it a cross platform terminal emulator. It supports several ANSI
    escape codes that are bespoke to Terminology.

    Murex can detect if it is running on Terminology and utilise those exclusive
    ANSI escape codes, so you don't have to remember different ways of working with
    different terminal emulators.

    ## Opening Images

    Using {{link "`open`" "open"}}, you can render an image directly in the
    terminal. Normally that would be a blocky "pixellated" representation using
    block characters. But if you're running Terminology, Murex will automatically
    switch to Terminology's ANSI escape sequences to render those images
    beautifully.
