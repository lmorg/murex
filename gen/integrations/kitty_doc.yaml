    ## Description

    Kitty it a cross platform terminal emulator. It supports several ANSI escape
    codes that are bespoke to Kitty.

    Murex can detect if it is running on Kitty and utilise those exclusive ANSI
    escape codes, so you don't have to remember different ways of working with
    different terminal emulators.

    ## Opening Images

    Using {{link "`open`" "open"}}, you can render an image directly in the
    terminal. Normally that would be a blocky "pixellated" representation using
    block characters. But if you're running Kitty, Murex will automatically switch
    to Kitty's ANSI escape sequences to render those images beautifully.
