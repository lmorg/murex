    ## Description

    iTerm2 it a macOS terminal emulator. It supports several ANSI escape codes that
    are bespoke to iTerm2.

    Murex can detect if it is running on iTerm2 and utilise those exclusive ANSI
    escape codes, so you don't have to remember different ways of working with
    different terminal emulators.

    ## Opening Images

    Using {{link "`open`" "open"}}, you can render an image directly in the
    terminal. Normally that would be a blocky "pixellated" representation using
    block characters. But if you're running iTerm2, Murex will automatically switch
    to iTerm2's ANSI escape sequences to render those images beautifully.

    For example:

    ```
    open https://murex.rocks/git-autocomplete.png
    ```
