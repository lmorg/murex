    An introduction to Murex modules and packages
  Description: |-
    ## Description
    
    Murex has it's own module system with namespacing and a package manager. But
    why should a shell need all this?

    The answer comes from years of me using Bash and wishing my Bash environment
    could be consistent across multiple machines. So this document is authored from
    the perspective of my personal usage ("me" being Laurence Morgan, the original
    author of Murex).

    What Murex's package system provides is:

    1. A way to ensure consistency across multiple platforms
    2. An easy way to extend Murex
    3. An easy way to share what you've extended with others
    4. An easy way to ensure your extensions are kept up-to-date
    5. An easy way to track what code is running in your shell and from where it
       was loaded

    Before I address those points in more detail, a bit of background into what
    modules and packages are:

    ### What Are Packages And Modules?

    ## Using Packages And Modules

    ### Consistency

    Package database are stored locally at `~/.murex_modules/packages.json`. This
    file is portable so any new machine can have `packages.json` imported. The
    easiest way of doing this is using `murex-package` which can import from a
    local path or HTTP(S) URI and automatically download any packages described in
    the database.

    For example the command I run on any new dev machine to import all of my DevOps
    tools and terminal preferences is the following:

    ```
    murex-package: import https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lmorg/770c71786935b44ba6667eaa9d470888/raw/fb7b79d592672d90ecb733944e144d722f77fdee/packages.json
    ```

    ### Extendability

    Namespacing allows for `private` functions which allows you to write smaller
    functions. Smaller functions are easier to write tests against (Murex also
    has an inbuilt testing and debugging tools).

    ### Sharing Code

    Packages can be hosted via HTTP(S) or git. Anyone can import anyone elses
    packages using `murex-package`. 

    ```
    murex-package: install https://github.com/lmorg/murex-module-murex-dev.git
    ```

    ### Updating Packages

    Updating packages is easy:

    ```
    murex-package: update
    ```

    ### Tracking Code

    All code loaded in Murex, every function, variable and event (etc) is stored
    in memory with metadata about where it was loaded from; which package, file and
    at what time. This is called `FileRef`.

    For more information on `FileRef` see the link below.
