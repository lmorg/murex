    Bang prefixing to reverse default actions

    ## Description

    Some builtins support a bang prefix, `!`, which provides a shorthand negative
    action to default behavior. For example, `set` defines a variable where as
    `!set` will undefine a variable.

    Sometimes the shortcut will be logical, like a **not** operator, as is the case
    with `and` where typically each result has to equal **true** normally or
    **false** if used in `!and`.
    
    Sometimes the shortcut will be more philosophical, such as with `config` where
    normal operations is to query or set configuration but `!config` resets the
    configuration to defaults (thus operating the same as `config default`).

    Please read the respecting commands doc for details on whether it supports a
    bang prefix and what the behavior of that prefix is.
