  Summary: >-
    Special variables reserved by _murex_
  Description: |-
    _murex_ reserves a few special variables which cannot be assigned via `set` nor
    `let`.

    The following is a list of reserved variables, their data type, and its usage:
    
    ### `SELF` (json)

    This returns meta information about the running scope.

    A 'scope' in _murex_ is a collection of code blocks to which variables and
    config are persistent within. In _murex_, a variable declared inside an `if` or
    `foreach` block will be persistent outside of their blocks as long as you're
    still inside the same function.

    Please see scoping document (link below) for more information on scoping.

    ```
    » function example { out $SELF }
    » example
    {
        "Parent": 11357,
        "Scope": 11357,
        "TTY": true,
        "Method": false,
        "Not": false,
        "Background": false,
        "Module": "murex"
    }
    ```

    #### Parent (num)

    This is the function ID of the parent function that created the scope. In
    some instances this will be the same value as scope FID. However if in doubt
    then please using **Scope** instead.

    #### Scope (num)

    The scope value here returns the function ID of the top level function in the
    scope.

    #### TTY (bool)

    A boolean value as to whether STDOUT is a TTY (ie are we printing to the
    terminal (TTY) or a pipe?)

    #### Method (bool)

    A boolean value to describe whether the current scope is a method (ie being
    called mid-way or at the end of a pipeline). 

    #### Not (bool)

    A boolean value which represents whether the function was called with a bang-
    prefix or not.

    #### Background (bool)

    A boolean value to identify whether the current scope is running in the
    background for foreground.

    #### Module (str)

    This will be the module string for the current scope.

    ### `ARGS` (json)

    This returns a JSON array of the command name and parameters within a given
    scope.

    ```
    » function example { out $ARGS }
    » example abc 1 2 3
    [
        "example",
        "abc",
        "1",
        "2",
        "3"
    ]
    ```

    ### `MUREX_EXE` (str)

    This is very similar to the `$SHELL` environmental variable in that it holds
    the full path to the running shell. The reason for defining a reserved variable
    is so that the shell path cannot be overridden.
