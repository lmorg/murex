    Special variables reserved by Murex
  Description: |-
    In Murex, there are five different classes of variables:

    1. Local variables (scope limited to a function et al)

    2. Module variables (scoped to a module)

    3. Global variables (available to every function within Murex but not shared
        with processes outside of the Murex's runtime)

    4. Environmental variables (available to every function and process -- internal
        and external to Murex)

    5. Reserved variables

    Reserved variables are data that are available to any code running within
    Murex and exposed as a variable.

    Reserved variables are called _reserved_ because they are read only. 
    
    Reserved variables are often also dynamic, returning different values based on
    contextual circumstances.
    
    ```
    Â» set SELF="foobar"
    Error in `set` (0,1): cannot set a reserved variable: SELF
    ```
