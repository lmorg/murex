    Strict Types In Expressions
  CategoryID: user-guide
  Summary: >-
    Expressions can auto-convert types or strictly honour data types
  Description: |-
    ## Automatic Type Conversion

    By default, any arithmetic expression on values that look like numbers will
    proceed to treat those values as numbers even if their underlying data type is
    not numeric. This can be illustrated with the following example:

    ```
    » 1 + "2"
    3
    ```

    This is useful because shell processing is generally operating on bytes, which
    often are treated as strings. Thus the OS doesn't have any concept of a numeric
    verses non-numeric parameter. As far as Linux or Windows knows, all numbers are
    strings too. So having Murex auto-convert values reduces your day-to-day
    cognitive overhead when working in the shell.

    ## Strictly Honouring Type Annotations

    Sometimes you might be writing Murex-native code and that code needs to care
    about type safety. For example, you might need the leading zeros retained in
    string when making comparisons. In situations like this, you can enable strict
    types via `config`:

    ```
    config set proc strict-types true
    ```

    Using the same example from the previous section but with **strict-types** set
    to `true`:

    ```
    » 1 + "2"
    Error in `expr` (0,1): cannot Add with string types
                        > Expression: 1 + "2"
                        >           :     ^
                        > Character : 5
                        > Symbol    : QuoteDouble
                        > Value     : '2'
    ```

    ## Scope

    **strict-types** will be {{link "scoped" "scoping"}} to that function and thus
    changing this option will not cause accidental side-effects in other functions.
