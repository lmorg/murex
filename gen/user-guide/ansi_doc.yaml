    Infixed constants that return ANSI escape sequences

    ## Description

    ANSI Constants is a Murex convention of passing ANSI escape sequences into
    strings. It uses the `{}` notation with the constant name placed in between two
    curly braces. eg `{GREEN}`. 

    ## Constants

    Rather than duplicate the constants from source, and risk the documentation and
    implementation drifting, this document will embed the source directly below.

    ```go
    {{ include "utils/ansi/consts.go" }}
    ```

    ### How To Read The Code Above

    Each line will look something a little like
    
    ```
    "GREEN":   {27, 91, 51, 50, 109},
    ```
    
    The part within quotes is the constant name, and the part that follows is the
    sequence of bytes that are infixed.

    So the example above will replace `{GREEN}` from within a string with the
    byte values of 27, 91, 51, 50 and 109 (in that order).

    ## Unsupported Constants

    If a constant does not exist in the above code, then the infix string is left
    unedited.

    ```
    # Green spelt correctly
    » out "{GREEN}PASSED{RESET}"
    PASSED
    
    # Green spelt incorrectly (ie so that it doesn't exist as a valid constant)
    » out "{GREEEEN}PASSED{RESET}"
    {GREEEEN}PASSED
    ```

    ## Enabling / Disabling ANSI Escape Sequences

    These sequences are enabled by default. To disable run the following:

    ```
    » config set shell color false
    ```

    You will need to add this to your Murex profile, `~/.murex_profile` to make
    it persistent.
