    _murex_ profile files

  Summary: >-
    A breakdown of the different files loaded on start up
  Description: |-
    _murex_ has several profile files which are loaded in the following order of
    execution:

    1. `~/.murex_preload`
    2. `~/.murex_modules/*/`
    3. `~/.murex_profile`

    ### `.murex_preload`

    This file should only used to define any environmental variables that might
    need to be set before the modules are loaded (eg including directories in
    `$PATH` if you have anything installed in non-standard locations).

    Most of the time this file will be empty bar the standard warning message:

        # This file is loaded before any murex modules. It should only contain
        # environmental variables required for the modules to work eg:
        #
        #     export PATH=...
        #
        # Any other profile config belongs in your profile script instead:
        # /home/$USER/.murex_profile

    This file is created upon the first run of _murex_.

    ### `.murex_modules/`

    _murex_'s module directory - where all the modules are installed
    to. This directory is managed by `murex-package` builtin.

    ### `.murex_profile`

    This file is comparable to `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` etc. It
    is the standard place to put all user and/or machine specific config in.

    `.murex_profile` is only read from the users home directory. Unlike bash et
    al, profiles will not be read from `/etc/profile.d` nor similar. Modules
    should be used in its place.
