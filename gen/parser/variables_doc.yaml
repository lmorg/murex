    String (`$`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Expand values as a string
  Description: |-
    The string token is used to tell _murex_ to expand variables and subshells as a
    string (ie one single parameter) irrespective of the data that is stored in the
    string. One handy common use case is file names where traditional POSIX shells
    would treat spaces as a new file, whereas _murex_ treats spaces as a printable
    character unless explicitly told to do otherwise.

    The string token must be followed with one of the following characters: 
    alpha, numeric, underscore (`_`) or a full stop / period (`.`).
 
  Examples: |-
    {{ include "gen/includes/parser-var-tokens.inc.md" }}

  Detail: |-
    Strings and subshells can be expanded inside double quotes, brace quotes as
    well as used as barewords. But they cannot be expanded inside single quotes.
    
    ```
    » set: example="World!"

    » out: Hello $example
    Hello World!

    » out: 'Hello $example'
    Hello $example

    » out: "Hello $example"
    Hello World!

    » out: %(Hello $example)
    Hello World!
    ```

    However you cannot expand arrays (`@`) inside any form of quotation since
    it wouldn't be clear how that value should be expanded relative to the
    other values inside the quote. This is why array and object builders (`%[]`
    and `%{}` respectively) support array variables but string builders (`%()`)
    do not.

  Title: >-
    Array (`@`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Expand values as an array
  Description: |-
    The array token is used to tell _murex_ to expand the string as multiple
    parameters (an array) rather than as a single parameter string.
  Examples: |-
    {{ include "gen/includes/parser-var-tokens.inc.md" }}
  Detail: |-
    Since arrays are expanded over multiple parameters, you cannot expand an array
    inside quoted strings like you can with a string variable:

    ```
    » out: "foo ${ ja: [1..5] } bar"
    foo ["1","2","3","4","5"] bar
    
    » out: "foo @{ ja: [1..5] } bar"
    foo  1 2 3 4 5  bar

    » %(${ ja: [1..5] })
    ["1","2","3","4","5"]   

    » %(@{ ja: [1..5] })
    @{ ja: [1..5] } 
    ```

- DocumentID: tilde
  Title: >-
    Tilde (`~`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Home directory path variable
  Description: |-
    The tilde token is used as a lazy reference to the users home directory.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » out: ~
    /home/bob

    » out: ~joe
    /home/joe
    ```
  Detail: |-
    Tilde can be expanded inside double quotes, brace quotes as well as used naked.
    But it cannot be expanded inside single quotes.
    
    ```
    » out: ~
    /home/bob

    » out: '~'
    ~

    » out: "~"
    /home/bob

    » out: %(~)
    /home/bob
    ```
