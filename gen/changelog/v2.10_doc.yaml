  Summary: >-
    This release brings a few minor improvements and bug fixes rather than big new
    headline features.
  Description: |-
    Breaking Changes:

    * None

    Features:

    * Added support for ranges to be used as variables. eg
    
        <pre><code>f: +f -> set v
        echo: @v[2..]</code></pre>

    * Complete re-write of `f`. It is now the tool I had always intended when I first created that builtin

    * `g` now supports being run as a method (eg to filter items from a file list)

    * `rx` now supports being run as a method (eg to filter items from a file list)

    * Updated autocompletes for `git`
    
    * Updated autocompletes for `terraform`

    Minor Changes:

    * Added support for profiling

    * Removed unused data types

    * Dropped `profile/` prefix from the module string for modules and profiles (as seen in `FileRef`)

    Bug Fixes:

    * Lots of improvements to how `||` and `&&` are used in other `runmode`'s, `try`, and `trypipe`

    * autoglob prompt now has a mutex wrapped around it to prevent concurrent processes sending the prompt haywire

    * Spellchecker no longer underlines partial words

    * Better removal of \\x16 and other non-printable characters leaking into readline
