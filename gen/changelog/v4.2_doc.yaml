    ### Breaking Changes

    none

    ### Features

    * new flag in `foreach`: `--step <int>`. This allows the `foreach` to jump indexes at a time. When used, all the lines jumped are merged into a JSON array and that is passed to the `foreach` nested code block

    * new alias `builtin` => `fexec builtin`. This was added to bring more familiarity to those coming from Bash et al ([#608](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/608))

    * on Darwin, Homebrew defaults are imported, just like you'd expect them to be from any other shell

    * new hotkeys ([#611](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/611)) ([#613](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/613)):

      1. `ctrl`+`a`: jump to beginning of line

      2. `ctrl`+`e`: jump to end of line

      3. `alt`+`f`: jump forwards a word at a time

      4. `alt`+`b`: jump backwards a word at a time

      5. `ctrl`+`k`: clear line after cursor position

      6. `ctrl`+`l`: clear entire screen

      7. `ctrl`+`g`: same as `esc`

    * `open` builtin should fallback to system default if type unknown ([#620](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/620))

    * `pre-prompt-func` added to `config`. Block runs before the interactive prompt is displayed

    * `post-prompt-func` added to `config`. Block runs after the interactive prompt has been exited but before any command lines have been executed

    * **auto-cd** option added to `config`: `config: set shell auto-cd true`. This allows you to traverse directories without having to prefix `cd`. By default it is disabled

    * Meta values added to `foreach`, `formap`, and `while`. Meta values are a `$.` variable that holds meta-information about the running block, such as the number of iterations in a loop

    * `command` alias for `exec` (for familiarity with Bash)

    * `builtin` alias for `fexec builtin` (for familiarity with Bash)

    ### Bug Fixes

    * brace encapsulated variables, eg `$(foobar)`, now autocomplete as expected

    * improvements to inlining images in iTerm2 when shell running on top of `tmux`. It still doesn't work reliably but this is an issue with `tmux` rather than Murex

    * `method` forwards exceptions rather than errors. This behaviour has been changed to surface issues as errors

    * `profile_preload.mx` added to profile defaults. This will be loaded before any of the OS-specific profiles

    * missing rune length check causing the shell to panic ([#617](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/617))

    * fixed deadlock in flag parsing

    * zero length string title bars should be ignored ([#614](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/614))

    * minor improvements to documentation
