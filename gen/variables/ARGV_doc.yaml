    `ARGV` (json)
  CategoryID: variables
  Summary: >-
    Array of the command name and parameters within a given
    scope
  Description: |-
    `ARGV` returns an array of the command name and parameters within a given
    scope. eg `function`, `private`, `autocomplete` or shell script.

    Unlike `$PARAMS`, `$ARGV` includes the function name.

    This is a reserved variable so it cannot be changed.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » function example { $ARGV }
    » example abc 1 2 3
    [
        "example",
        "abc",
        "1",
        "2",
        "3"
    ]
    ```

    ### Deprecation of `ARGS`

    In Murex versions 4.x and below, this variable was named `ARGS` (with an 'S').
    However in Murex 5.x and above it was renamed to `ARGV` (with a 'V') to unify
    the name with other languages.

    `ARGS` will remain available for compatibility reasons but is considered
    deprecated and may be removed from future releases.
