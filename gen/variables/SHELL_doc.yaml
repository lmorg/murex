    Path of current shell
  Description: |-
    `SHELL` is an environmental variable containing the full path to the current
    shell -- which in our case is Murex.

    This variable is set by Murex to conform to standards however, being an
    environmental variable, it can be overwritten via `export`. Thus you are
    recommended to use `MUREX_EXE`, which is a reserved variable, if you require
    precision.
