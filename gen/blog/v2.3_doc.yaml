    This release includes significant changes to the interactive terminal
  Description: |-
    This release brings some major improvements to the discoverability of commands
    and their parameters in the interactive terminal.

    ### User Facing Changes:

    * New builtin: `method`. This is used to help turn some commands into a
      "method", similar in concept to object orientated development where the tab-
      completer will return a list of other commands that are compatible with the
      formers output data types. It's purely an autocompletion tool and has no
      effect in shell scripts.

    * Autocompletion suggestions will differ based on what pipes are used. The idea
      behind this is to improve the discoverability of commands. All tokens can
      still be used to pipeline to any command type (like before). This rule only
      affects autocomplete suggestions in the interactive prompt.

      - `|` will show all available aliases, functions, builtins and external
        commands, as usual

      - `->` will show only compatible commands defined in `method` (see above)

    * Autocompletion de-duplication now places hyphen-prefixed flags at the end of
      the results when sorting. This helps bring more relevant flags forward, with
      hyphen-prefixed flags still visible when users press `-`

    * External commands return a error message if the exit status is non-zero
      ([issue #299](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/299))
      
      <pre><code>» exec: false
      Error in `exec` (1,1): exit status 1
      </code></pre>

    * `Index()` (`[`) now returns a different data type from the root object if the
      element is a string, integer, float64, boolean or nil ([issue #2316](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/316))

    * `runtime` was missing a few flags for reporting supported data types against
      the newer APIs

    * Generic types (`*` / `generic`) to include two spaces between columns when
      marshalled

    * Syntax highlighter colour tweaks -- no longer using background highlighting
      because that looks weird and unreadable on some terminal colour schemes
    
    * Bug fixes to the fast parser

    * Bug fixes to readline merged from `v2.2.1200` ([issue #362](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/362))

    ### Non-User Facing / Maintenance Changes

    * `hcl` and `bson` types now use `ReadArray` templates so their behavior should
      mimic JSON and YAML

    * Fast parser is now aware of which pipe token (eg `|`, `->`, `=>`, `?`) is used

    * Unit test concurrency fix

    * New tests written for the fast parser

    * Updated documentation
