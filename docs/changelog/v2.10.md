# v2.10

This release brings a few minor improvements and bug fixes rather than big new headline features.

### Breaking Changes:

* None

### Features:

* Added support for ranges to be used as variables. eg
  ```
  f: +f -> set v
  echo: @v[2..]
  ```

* Complete re-write of `f`. It is now the tool I had always intended when I first created that builtin

* `g` now supports being run as a method (eg to filter items from a file list)

* `rx` now supports being run as a method (eg to filter items from a file list)

* Updated autocompletes for `git`

* Updated autocompletes for `terraform`

### Minor Changes:

* Added support for profiling

* Removed unused data types

* Dropped `profile/` prefix from the module string for modules and profiles (as seen in `FileRef`)

### Bug Fixes:

* Lots of improvements to how `||` and `&&` are used in other `runmode`'s, `try`, and `trypipe`

* autoglob prompt now has a mutex wrapped around it to prevent concurrent processes sending the prompt haywire

* Spellchecker no longer underlines partial words

* Better removal of \\x16 and other non-printable characters leaking into readline
