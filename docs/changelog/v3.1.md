# v3.1

This release includes mostly bug fixes and new experimental features which are opt into. To enable all experimental features, set the environmental variable `MUREX_EXPERIMENTAL` to any value. Or you can enable specific features individually via `config`

### Breaking Changes

* None

### Features

* `default` statement added to `switch` (this will deprecate `catch`, albeit `catch` will remain supported for compatibility)

* Option to change start directory: `config: set shell start-directory $path` (where $path is the working directory you wish to start the shell in)

* `onCommandCompletion` event no spawns a pty. This allows capturing of stdout while still presenting a tty to the executing process

* EXPERIMENTAL: preview files. This can be enabled via `config: set shell preview-enabled true`

* EXPERIMENTAL: preview images. This can be enabled via `config: set shell preview-images true`

* EXPERIMENTAL: tty buffer. This can be enabled via `config: set shell tty-buffer-enabled true`

* `ctrl`+`r` has been tweaked to make it more user friendly

* Long overdue SIGWINCH signal handler to reflow after terminal resized

* Lots of improvements to documentation

### Non-User Facing / Maintenance Changes:

* none

### Bug Fixes

* re-added `columns` data-type to fix `jobs` builtin

* added bang alternatives to the glob exception list

* added missing support for `&&` tokens in expressions

* `![]` can now produce empty maps

* fixed regression bug in file pipe mutex
