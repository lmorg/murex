# Reserved Variables

> Special variables reserved by Murex

In Murex, there are five different classes of variables:

1. Local variables (scope limited to a function et al)

2. Module variables (scoped to a module)

3. Global variables (available to every function within Murex but not shared
    with processes outside of the Murex's runtime)

4. Environmental variables (available to every function and process -- internal
    and external to Murex)

5. Reserved variables

Reserved variables are data that are available to any code running within
Murex and exposed as a variable.

Reserved variables are called _reserved_ because they are read only. 

Reserved variables are often also dynamic, returning different values based on
contextual circumstances.

```
Â» set SELF="foobar"
Error in `set` (0,1): cannot set a reserved variable: SELF
```
