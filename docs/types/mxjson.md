# _murex_ Shell Guide

## Data-Type Reference: mxjson

> Murex-flavoured JSON (primitive)

### Description

mxjson is an extension to JSON designed to integrate more seamlessly when
use as a configuration file. Thus mxjson supports comments and _murex_ code
blocks embedded into the JSON schema.

> mxjson is a format that is pre-parsed into a valid JSON format.

mxjson isn't currently a proper _murex_ data-type in that you cannot marshal
and unmarshal mxjson files. Currently it is a format that is only supported
by a small subset of _murex_ builtins (eg `config` and `autocomplete`) where
config might embed _murex_ code blocks.

### mxjson Features The Following Enhancements

#### Line Comments

Line comments are prefixed with a 'hash', `#`, just like with regular _murex_
code.

#### Block Quotation

Code blocks are quoted with `(`, `)`. For example, below "ExampleFunction"
uses the `({ block quote })` method.

    {
        "ExampleFunction": ({
            out: "This is an example _murex_ function"
            if { =1==2 } then {
                err: "The laws of the universe are broken"
            }
        })
    }
    
Any block quoted by this method will be converted to the following valid JSON:

    {
        "ExampleFunction": "\n    out: \"This is an example _murex_ function\"\n    if { =1==2 } then {\n        err: \"The laws of the universe are broken\"\n    }"
    }
