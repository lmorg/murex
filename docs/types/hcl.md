# _murex_ Shell Guide

## Data-Type Reference: `hcl` 

> HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

### Description

The description below is taken from the HCL git repository's [README](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl):

> HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built by
> HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language
> that is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but
> specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.
>
> HCL is also fully JSON compatible. That is, JSON can be used as completely
> valid input to a system expecting HCL. This helps makes systems interoperable
> with other systems.

HCL support within _murex_ is pretty mature however it is not considered a
primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
expect in most deployments of _murex_, it's still an optional package and
thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
external source packages for the shell to compile.

### Examples

    terraform {
      required_version = "~> 0.11.5"
    }
    
    data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}
    
    data "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
      id = "${var.vpc_id}"
    }
    
    data "aws_route53_zone" "external" {
      zone_id = "${var.external_hosted_zone_id}"
    }
    
    data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role_policy" {
      statement {
        actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
        effect  = "Allow"
    
        principals {
          identifiers = ["ec2.amazonaws.com"]
          type        = "Service"
        }
      }
    }
    
See the HashiCorp's [documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) for HCL syntax.

### Supported Hooks

* `Marshal()`
    Supported via a JSON marshaller because HCL is designed to be written by humans but "compiled" into JSON

    Works with HCL arrays. Maps are converted into arrays
* `ReadIndex()`
    Works against all properties in HCL
* `ReadMap()`
    Works with HCL maps
* `ReadNotIndex()`
    Works against all properties in HCL
