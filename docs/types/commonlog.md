# _murex_ Shell Guide

## Data-Type Reference: `commonlog` 

> Apache httpd "common" log format

### Description

Apache httpd supports a few different log formats. This _murex_ type is for
parsing the "common" log format.

### Detail

The code here is very rudimentary. If you have large log files or need more complex
data querying then this data-type is probably not the right tool. Maybe try one of
the following:

* [Firesword](https://github.com/lmorg/firesword) - for command line analysis
* [Plasmasword](https://github.com/lmorg/plasmasword) - exports fields to an sqlite3 or mysql database

### Supported Hooks

* `Marshal()`
    Supported though no unmarshalling is currently supported
* `ReadArray()`
    Supported. Each line is considered an index (like with `str` data-type)
* `ReadIndex()`
    Entire log file is read and then the indexes are derived from there
* `ReadMap()`
    Not supported, currently a work in progress
* `ReadNotIndex()`
    Entire log file is read and then the indexes are derived from there
