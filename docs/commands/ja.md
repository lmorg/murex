# _murex_ Shell Guide

## Command Reference: `ja`

> A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array

### Description

_murex_ has a pretty sophisticated builtin for generating JSON arrays.
It works a little bit like Bash's `{1..9}` syntax but includes a few
additional nifty features.

### Usage

    ja: [start..end] -> <stdout>
    ja: [start..end.base] -> <stdout>
    ja: [start..end,start..end] -> <stdout>
    ja: [start..end][start..end] -> <stdout>

### Examples

    » ja: [1..5]
    [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4",
        "5"
    ]
    
    » ja: [Monday..Sunday]
    [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday"
    ]
    
Please note that as per the first example, all arrays generated by `ja` are
arrays of strings - even if you're command is ranging over integers.

### Detail

Please read the documentation on `a` for a more detailed breakdown on of
`ja`'s supported features.
