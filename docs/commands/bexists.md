# Check Builtin Exists (`bexists`)

> Check which builtins exist

## Description

`bexists` takes an array of parameters and returns which commands have been
compiled into Murex. The 'b' in `bexists` stands for 'builtins'

## Usage

```
bexists command... -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

```
Â» bexists qr gzip runtime config
{
    "Installed": [
        "runtime",
        "config"
    ],
    "Missing": [
        "qr",
        "gzip"
    ]
}
```

## Detail

This builtin dates back to the start of Murex when all of the builtins were
considered optional. This was intended to be a way for scripts to determine
which builtins were compiled. Since then `runtime` has absorbed and centralized
a number of similar commands which have since been deprecated. The same fate
might also happen to `bexists` however it is in use by a few modules and for
that reason alone it has been spared from the axe.
