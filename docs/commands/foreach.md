## Command Reference: `foreach`

> Iterate through an array

### Description

`foreach` reads an array or map from STDIN and iterates through it, running
a code block for each iteration with the value of the iterated element passed
to it.

### Usage

    <stdin> -> foreach variable { code-block } -> <stdout>
    
    <stdin> -> foreach { -> code-block } -> <stdout>

### Examples

There are two basic ways you can write a `foreach` loop depending on how you
want the iterated element passed to the code block.

The first option is to specify a temporary variable which can be read by the
code block:

    » a [1..3] -> foreach i { out $i }
    1
    2
    3
    
> Please note that the variable is specified **without** the dollar prefix,
> then used in the code block **with** the dollar prefix.

The second option is for the code block's STDIN to read the element:

    » a [1..3] -> foreach { -> cat }
    1
    2
    3
    
> STDIN can only be read as the first command. If you cannot process the
> element on the first command then it is recommended you use the first
> option (passing a variable) instead.

### Detail

#### Preserving the data-type

`foreach` will preserve the data-type read from STDIN in all instances where
data is being passed along the pipeline:

* The temporary variable will be created with the same data-type as
  `foreach`'s STDIN
* The code block's STDIN will have the same data-type as `foreach`'s STDIN
* `foreeach`'s STDOUT will also be the same data-type as it's STDIN

This last point means you may need to `cast` your data if you're writing
data in a different format. For example the following is creating a YAML list
however the data-type is defined as `json`:

    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out "- $i" }
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    
    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out "- $i" } -> debug -> [[ /DataType/Murex ]]
    json
    
Thus any marshalling or other data-type-aware API's would fail because they
are expecting `json` and receiving an incompatible data format.

This can be resolved via `cast`:

    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out "- $i" } -> cast yaml
    - 1
    - 2
    - 3
    
    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out "- $i" } -> cast yaml -> debug -> [[ /DataType/Murex ]]
    yaml
    
The output is the same but now it's defined as `yaml` so any further pipelined
processes will now automatically use YAML marshallers when reading that data.

#### Tips when writing JSON inside for loops

One of the drawbacks (or maybe advantages, depending on your perspective) of
JSON is that parsers generally expect a complete file for processing in that
the JSON specification requires closing tags for every opening tag. This means
it's not always suitable for streaming. For example

    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out ({ "$i": $i }) }
    { "1": 1 }
    { "2": 2 }
    { "3": 3 }
    
**What does this even mean and how can you build a JSON file up sequentially?**

One answer if to write the output in a streaming file format and convert back
to JSON

    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out (- "$i": $i) }
    - "1": 1
    - "2": 2
    - "3": 3
    
    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out (- "$i": $i) } -> cast yaml -> format json
    [
        {
            "1": 1
        },
        {
            "2": 2
        },
        {
            "3": 3
        }
    ]
    
**What if I'm returning an object rather than writing one?**

The problem with building JSON structures from existing structures is that you
can quickly end up with invalid JSON due to the specifications strict use of
commas.

    » config -> [ shell ] -> formap k v { $v -> alter /Foo Bar }
    {
        "Data-Type": "bool",
        "Default": true,
        "Description": "Display the interactive shell's hint text helper. Please note, even when this is disabled, it will still appear when used for regexp searches and other readline-specific functions",
        "Dynamic": false,
        "Foo": "Bar",
        "Global": true,
        "Value": true
    }
    {
        "Data-Type": "block",
        "Default": "{ progress $PID }",
        "Description": "Murex function to execute when an `exec` process is stopped",
        "Dynamic": false,
        "Foo": "Bar",
        "Global": true,
        "Value": "{ progress $PID }"
    }
    {
        "Data-Type": "bool",
        "Default": true,
        "Description": "ANSI escape sequences in Murex builtins to highlight syntax errors, history completions, {SGR} variables, etc",
        "Dynamic": false,
        "Foo": "Bar",
        "Global": true,
        "Value": true
    }
    ...
    
Luckily JSON also has it's own streaming format: JSON lines (`jsonl`)

    » config -> [ shell ] -> formap k v { $v -> alter /Foo Bar } -> cast jsonl -> format json
    [
        {
            "Data-Type": "bool",
            "Default": true,
            "Description": "Write shell history (interactive shell) to disk",
            "Dynamic": false,
            "Foo": "Bar",
            "Global": true,
            "Value": true
        },
        {
            "Data-Type": "int",
            "Default": 4,
            "Description": "Maximum number of lines with auto-completion suggestions to display",
            "Dynamic": false,
            "Foo": "Bar",
            "Global": true,
            "Value": "6"
        },
        {
            "Data-Type": "bool",
            "Default": true,
            "Description": "Display some status information about the stop process when ctrl+z is pressed (conceptually similar to ctrl+t / SIGINFO on some BSDs)",
            "Dynamic": false,
            "Foo": "Bar",
            "Global": true,
            "Value": true
        },
    ...
