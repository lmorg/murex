    Get Nested Element (`[[ Element ]]`)
  CategoryID: parser
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.struct ]
  Summary: >-
    Outputs an element from a nested structure
  Description: |-
    Outputs an element from an array, map or table. Unlike **index** (`[`),
    **element** takes a path parameter which means it can work inside nested
    structures without pipelining multiple commands together. However this
    comes with the drawback that you can only return one element.

    **Element** (`[[`) also doesn't support the bang prefix (unlike) **index**.

    Please note that indexes in Murex are counted from zero.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> [[ element ]] -> <stdout>

    $variable[[ element ]] -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Array elements

    Return the 2nd element in an array:

    ```
    » ja [0..9] -> [[ /1 ]]
    [
        "1",
    ]
    ```

    ### Used with config

    Return the data-type and description of **config shell syntax-highlighting**:

    ```
    » config -> [[ /shell/syntax-highlighting/Data-Type ]]
    bool
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    ### Element counts from zero

    Indexes in Murex behave like any other computer array in that all arrays
    start from zero (`0`).

    ### Alternative path separators

    **Element** uses the first character in the path as the separator. So the
    following are all valid parameters:

    ```
    » config -> [[ ,shell,syntax-highlighting,Data-Type ]]
    bool

    » config -> [[ >shell>syntax-highlighting>Data-Type ]]
    bool

    » config -> [[ \|shell\|syntax-highlighting\|Data-Type ]]
    bool

    » config -> [[ >shell>syntax-highlighting>Data-Type ]]
    bool
    ```

    However there are a few of caveats:

    1. Currently **element** does not support unicode separators. All separators
       must be 1 byte characters. This limitation is highlighted as a bug, albeit
       a low priority one. If this limitation does directly affect you then raise
       an issue on GitHub to get the priority bumped up.

    2. Any shell tokens (eg pipe `|`, `;`, `}`, etc) will need to be escaped. For
       readability reasons it is recommended not to use such characters even
       though it is technically possible to.

    ```
        # Would fail because the semi-colon is an unescaped / unquoted shell token
        config -> [[ ;shell-syntax-highlighting;Data-Type ]]
    ```

    3. Please also make sure you don't use a character that is also used inside
       key names because keys _cannot_ be escaped. For example both of the
       following would fail:

    ```
        # Would fail because 'syntax-highlighting' and 'Data-Type' both also contain
        # the separator character
        config -> [[ -shell-syntax-highlighting-Data-Type ]]

        # Would fail because you cannot escape key names (escaping happens at the
        # shell parser level rather than command parameter level)
        config -> [[ -shell-syntax\-highlighting-Data\-Type ]]
    ```

    ### Quoting parameters

    In Murex, everything is a function. Thus even `[[` is a function name and
    the closing `]]` is actually a last parameter. This means the recommended way
    to quote **element** parameters is to quote specific key names or the entire
    path:

    ```
    » config -> [[ /shell/"syntax-highlighting"/Data-Type ]]
    bool

    » config -> [[ "|shell|syntax-highlighting|Data-Type" ]]
    bool
    ```
