  Summary: >-
    Outputs a ranged subset of data from stdin
  Description: |-
    This will read from stdin and output a subset of data in a defined range.

    The range can be defined as a number of different range types - such as the
    content of the array or it's index / row number. You can also omit either
    the start or the end of the search criteria to cover all items before or
    after the remaining search criteria.

    **Please note that `@[` syntax has been deprecated in favour of `[` syntax
    instead**
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> [start..end]flags -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Include everything after string match:

    ```
    » a [January..December] -> [March..]se
    April
    May
    June
    July
    August
    September
    October
    November
    December
    ```

    ### Range from the 6th to the 10th index

    By default, ranges start from one, `1`:

    ```
    » a [January..December] -> [5..9]
    May
    June
    July
    August
    September
    ```

    ### Return the first 3

    This usage is similar to `head -n3`:

    ```
    » a [January..December] -> [..3]
    October
    November
    December
    ```

    ### Return the last 3

    This usage is similar to `tail -n3`:

    ```
    » a [January..December] -> [-3..]
    October
    November
    December
    ```
  Flags:
    n: numeric offset (indexed from 0)
    s: exact string match
    r: regexp match
    e: exclude the start and end search criteria from the range
    b: removes blank (empty) lines from source
    t: trims whitespace from source
