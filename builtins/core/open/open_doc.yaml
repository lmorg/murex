    Open File (`open`)

  Summary: >-
    Open a file with a preferred handler
  Description: |-
    `open` is a smart tool for reading files:
    
    1. It will read a file from disk or a HTTP(S) endpoints
    2. Detect the file type via file extension or HTTP header `Content-Type`
    3. It intelligently writes to stdout
      - If stdout is a TTY it will perform any transformations to render to the
        terminal (eg using inlining images)
      - If stdout is a pipe then it will write a byte stream with the relevant
        data-type
    4. If there are no open handlers then it will fallback to the systems default.
       eg `open` (on macOS, Linux), `open-xdg` (X11), etc.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    open filename[.gz]|uri -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » open https://api.github.com/repos/lmorg/murex/issues -> foreach issue { out "$issue[number]: $issue[title]" }

    ### File Extensions

    Supported file extensions are listed in `config` under the app and key names of
    **shell**, **extensions**.

    Unsupported file extensions are defaulted to generic, `*`.

    Files with a `.gz` extension are assumed to be gzipped and thus are are
    automatically expanded.

    ### MIME Types

    The `Content-Type` HTTP header is compared against a list of MIME types, which
    are stored in `config` under the app and key names of **shell**, **mime-types**.

    There is a little bit of additional logic to determine the Murex data-type to
    use should the MIME type not appear in `config`, as seen in the following code:

    ```go
    {{ include "lang/define_mime.go" }}
    ```

    ### HTTP User Agent

    `open`'s user agent is the same as `get` and `post` and is configurable via
    `config` under they app **http**

    ```
    » config -> [http]

        }
    }
    ```

    ### Open Flags

    If the `open` builtin falls back to using the systems default (like `open-xdg`)
    then the only thing that gets passed is the path being opened. If the path is
    stdin then a temporary file will be created. If you want to pass command line
    flags to `open-xdg` (for example), then you need to call that command directly.
    In the case of macOS and some Linux systems, that might look like:

    ```
    exec open --flags filename
    ```

    Creates a handler function for `open`
  Description: |-
    `openagent` creates and destroys handler functions for writing data to the
    terminal when accessed via `open` and stdout is a TTY.
  Usage: |-
    Display code block for an associated data-type:

    ```
    openagent get data-type
    ```

    Define an `open` handler function:

    ```
    openagent set data-type { code-block }
    ```

    Undefine an `open` handler:

    ```
    !openagent data-type
    ```

    ### FileRef

    It is possible to track which shell script or module installed what `open`
    handler by checking `runtime --open-agents` and checking it's **FileRef**.
