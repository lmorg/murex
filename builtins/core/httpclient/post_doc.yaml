    #### JSON return

    `POST` returns a JSON object with the following fields:

    ```
    {
        "Status": {
            "Code": integer,
            "Message": string,
        },
        "Headers": {
            string [
                string...
            ]
        },
        "Body": string
    }
    ```

    The concept behind this is it provides and easier path for scripting eg pulling
    specific fields via the index, `[`, function.

    #### `post` as a method

    Running `post` as a method will transmit the contents of STDIN as part of the
    body of the HTTP POST request. When run as a method you have to include a second
    parameter specifying the Content-Type MIME.

    #### Configurable options

    `post` has a number of behavioral options which can be configured via _murex_'s
    standard `config` tool:

    ```
    config: -> [ http ]
    ```

    To change a default, for example the user agent string:

    ```
    config: set http user-agent "bob"
    post: google.com
    ```

    This enables sane, repeatable and readable defaults. Read the documents on
    `config` for more details about it's usage and the rational behind the command.
