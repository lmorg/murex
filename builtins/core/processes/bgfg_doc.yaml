    `bg`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Run processes in the background
  Description: |-
    `bg` supports two modes: it can either be run as a function block which will
    execute in the background, or it can take stopped processes and daemonize
    them.
  Usage: |-
    POSIX only:
     ```
     bg { code block }

     bg fid
     ```
  Examples: |-

    ```
    bg { sleep 5; out "Morning" }
    ```

  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    The examples above will work on any system (Windows included). However the
    `ctrl+z` usage of backgrounding a stopped process (like Bash) is only
    supported on POSIX systems due to the limitation of required signals on
    non-platforms. This means the usage described in the examples is cross
    cross platform while `bg int` currently does not work on Windows nor Plan 9.

    for Windows (due to the kernel not supporting the right signals) nor Plan 9.
