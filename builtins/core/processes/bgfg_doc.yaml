    Background Process (`bg`)
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs:
    - commands.proc
  Summary: >-
    Run processes in the background
  Description: |-
    `bg` supports two modes: it can either be run as a function block which will
    execute in the background, or it can take stopped processes and daemonize
    them.
  Usage: |-
    POSIX only:

     ```
     bg { code block }

     bg fid
     ```
  Examples: |-

    ```
    bg { sleep 5; out "Morning" }
    ```

  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    The examples above will work on any system (Windows included). However the
    `ctrl+z` usage of backgrounding a stopped process (like Bash) is only
    supported on POSIX systems due to the limitation of required signals on
    non-platforms. This means the usage described in the examples is cross
    cross platform while `bg int` currently does not work on Windows nor Plan 9.

    This builtin is only supported on POSIX systems. There is no support planned
    for Windows (due to the kernel not supporting the right signals) nor Plan 9.
