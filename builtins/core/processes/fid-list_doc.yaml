  Summary: >-
    Lists all running functions within the current Murex session
  Description: |-
    `fid-list` is a tool for outputting all the functions currently managed by that
    Murex session. Those functions could be Murex functions, builtins or any
    external executables launched from Murex.

    Conceptually `fid-list` is a little like `ps` (on POSIX systems) however
    `fid-list` was not written to be POSIX compliant.

    Multiple flags cannot be used with each other.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    fid-list [ flag ] -> <stdout>
    ```

    `jobs` is an alias for `fid-list: --jobs`:
    ```
    jobs -> <stdout>
    ```
  #Examples: |-
  Flags:
    --csv: >-
      Output table in a `csv` format
    --jsonl: >-
      Output table in a jsonlines (`jsonl`) format (defaulted to when piped)
    --tty: >-
      Force default TTY output even when piped
    --jobs: >-
      Show background and stopped jobs
    --stopped: >-
      Returns a `json` map of stopped jobs
    --background: >-
      Returns a `json` map of background jobs
    --help: >-
      Outputs a list of parameters and a descriptions
  Detail: |-
    Because Murex is a multi-threaded shell, builtins are not forked processes
    like in a traditional / POSIX shell. This means that you cannot use the
    operating systems default process viewer (eg `ps`) to list Murex functions.
    This is where `fid-list` comes into play. It is used to view all the functions
    and processes that are managed by the current Murex session. That would
    include:

    * any aliases within Murex
    * public and private Murex functions
    * builtins (eg `fid-list` is a builtin command)
    * any external processes that were launched from within this shell session
    * any background functions or processes of any of the above
