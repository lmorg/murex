  Summary: >-
    Set definitions for tab-completion in the command line
  Description: |-
    `autocomplete` digests a JSON schema and uses that to define the tab-
    completion rules for suggestions in the interactive command line.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    autocomplete get [ command ] -> <stdout>

    autocomplete set command { mxjson }
    ```

    ### Undefining autocomplete

    Currently there is no support for undefining an autocompletion rule however
    you can overwrite existing rules.
    
    ## Directives

    The directives are listed below. Headings are formatted as follows:
    
    ```
    "DirectiveName": json data-type (default value)
    ```

    Where "default value" is what will be auto-populated at run time if you
    don't define an autocomplete schema manually.

    ### "Alias": string ("")

    Aliases are used inside **FlagValues** as a way of pointing one flag to another
    without duplicating code. eg `-v` and `--version` might be the same flag. Or
    `-?`, `-h` and `--help`. With **Alias** you can write the definitions for one
    flag and then point all the synonyms as an alias to that definition.

    ### "AllowAny": boolean (false)

    The way autocompletion works in _murex_ is the suggestion engine looks for
    matches and if it fines one, it then moves onto the next index in the JSON
    schema. This means unexpected values typed in the interactive terminal will
    break the suggestion engine's ability to predict what the next expected
    parameter should be. Setting **AllowAny** to `true` tells the suggestion
    engine to accept any value as the next parameter thus allowing it to then
    predict the next parameter afterwards.

    This directive isn't usually necessary because such fields are often the last
    parameter or most parameters can be detectable with a reasonable amount of
    effort. However **AllowAny** is often required for more complex command line
    tools.

    ### "AllowMultiple": boolean (false)

    Set to `true` to enable multiple parameters following the same rules as defined
    in this index. For example the following will suggest directories on each tab
    for multiple parameters:

    ```
    autocomplete set example { [{
        "IncDirs": true,
        "AllowMultiple": true
    }] }
    ```

    ### "AnyValue": boolean (false)

    Deprecated. Please use **AllowAny** instead.

    ### "AutoBranch": boolean (false)

    Use this in conjunction with **Dynamic**. If the return is an array of paths,
    for example `[ "/home/foo", "/home/bar" ]` then **AutoBranch** will return
    the following patterns in the command line:

    ```
    » example [tab]
    # suggests "/home/"

    » example /home/[tab]
    # suggests "/home/foo" and "/home/bar"
    ```

    Please note that **AutoBranch**'s behavior is also dependant on a "shell"
    `config` setting, recursive-enabled":

    ```
    » config get shell recursive-enabled
    true
    ```

    ### "Dynamic": string ("")

    This is a _murex_ block which returns an array of suggestions.

    Code inside that block are executed like a function and the parameters will
    mirror the same as those parameters entered in the interactive terminal.

    ### "DynamicDesc": string ("")

    This is very similar to **Dynamic** except your function should return a
    map instead of an array. Where each key is the suggestion and the value is
    a description.

    The description will appear either in the hint text or alongside the
    suggestion - depending on which suggestion "popup" you define (see
    **ListView**).

    ### "ExecCmdline": boolean (false)

    Sometimes you'd want your autocomplete suggestions to aware of the output
    returned from the commands that preceded it. For example the suggestions
    for `[` (index) will depend entirely on what data is piped into it.

    **ExecCmdline** tells _murex_ to run the commandline up until the command
    which your cursor is editing and pipe that output to the STDIN of that
    commands **Dynamic** or **DynamicDesc** code block.

    > This is a dangerous feature to enable so **ExecCmdline** is only honoured
    > if the commandline is considered "safe". **Dynamic** / **DynamicDesc**
    > will still be executed however if the commandline is "unsafe" then your
    > dynamic autocompletion blocks will have no STDIN.

    Because this is a dangerous feature, your partial commandline will only
    execute if the following conditions are met:

    * the commandline must be one pipeline (eg `;` tokens are not allowed)
    * the commandline must not have any new line characters
    * there must not be any redirection, including named pipes
      (eg `cmd <namedpipe>`) and the STDOUT/STDERR switch token (`?`)
    * the commandline doesn't inline any variables (`$strings`, `@arrays`) or
      functions (`${subshell}`, `$[index]`)
    * lastly all commands are whitelisted in "safe-commands"
      (`config get shell safe-commands`)

    If these criteria are met, the commandline is considered "safe"; if any of
    those conditions fail then the commandline is considered "unsafe".

    _murex_ will come with a number of sane commands already included in its
    `safe-commands` whitelist however you can add or remove them using `config`

    ```
    » function: foobar { -> match foobar }
    » config: eval shell safe-commands { -> append foobar }
    ```

    Remember that **ExecCmdline** is designed to be included with either
    **Dynamic** or **DynamicDesc** and those code blocks would need to read
    from STDIN:

    ```
    autocomplete set "[" { [{
        "AnyValue": true,
        "AllowMultiple": true,
        "ExecCmdline": true,
        "Dynamic": ({
            switch ${ get-type: stdin } {
                case * {
                    <stdin> -> [ 0: ] -> format json -> [ 0 ]
                }
                
                catch {
                    <stdin> -> formap k v { out $k } -> cast str -> append "]"
                }
            }
        })
    }] }
    ```

    ### "FileRegexp": string ("")

    When set in conjunction with **IncFiles**, this directive will filter on files
    files which match the regexp string. eg to only show ".txt" extensions you can
    use the following:
    
    ```
    autocomplete set notepad.exe { [{
        "IncFiles": true,
        "FileRegexp": (\.txt)
    }] }
    ```
    
    > Please note that you may need to double escape any regexp strings: escaping
    > the `.` match and then also escaping the escape character in JSON. It is
    > recommended you use the `mxjson` method of quoting using parentheses as this
    > will compile that string into JSON, automatically adding additional escaping
    > where required.

    ### "FlagValues": map of arrays (null)

    This is a map of the flags with the values being the same array of directive
    as the top level.

    This allows you to nest operations by flags. eg when a flag might accept
    multiple parameters.

    ### "Flags": array of strings (auto-populated from man pages)

    Setting **Flags** is the fastest and easiest way to populate suggestions
    because it is just an array of strings. eg

    ```
    autocomplete set example { [{
        "Flags": [ "foo", "bar" ]
    }] }
    ```

    If a command doesn't **Flags** already defined when you request a completion
    suggestion but that command does have a man page, then **Flags** will be
    automatically populated with any flags identified from an a quick parse of
    the man page. However because man pages are written to be human readable
    rather than machine parsable, there may not be a 100% success rate with the
    automatic man page parsing.
        
    ### "FlagsDesc": map of strings (null)

    This is the same concept as **Flags** except it is a map with the suggestion
    as a key and description as a value. This distinction is the same as the
    difference between **Dynamic** and **DynamicDesc**.

    Please note that currently man page parsing cannot provide a description so
    only **Flags** get auto-populated.

    ### "Goto": string ("")

    This is a `goto` in programming terms. While "ugly" it does allow for quick and
    easy structural definitions without resorting to writing the entire
    autocomplete in code.

    **Goto** takes a string which represents the path to jump to from the top level
    of that autocomplete definition. The path should look something like:
    `/int/string/int/string....` where
    
    * the first character is the separator,

    * the first value is an integer that relates to the index in your autocomplete
      array,

    * the second value is a string which points to the flag value map (if you
      defined **FlagValues**),

    * the third value is the integer of the autocomplete array inside that
    **FlagValues** map,

    * ...and so on as necessary.

    An example of a really simple **Goto**:

    ```
    autocomplete set dd { [
        {
            "Flags": [ "if=", "of=", "bs=", "iflag=", "oflag=", "count=", "status=" ],
            "FlagValues": {
                "if": [{ 
                    "IncFiles": true,
                    "AnyValue": true
                }],
                "of": [{ 
                    "IncFiles": true,
                    "AnyValue": true
                }]
            }
        },
        {
            "Goto": "/0"
        }
    ] }
    ```

    **Goto** is given precidense over any other directive. So ensure it's the only
    directive in it's group.

    ### "IncDirs": boolean (false)

    Enable to include directories.
    
    Not needed if **IncFiles** is set to `true`.

    Behavior of this directive can be altered with `config set shell
    recursive-enabled`

    ### "IncExeAll": boolean (false)

    Enable this to any executables. Suggestions will include aliases, functions
    builtins and any executables in `$PATH`. It will not include private functions.

    ### "IncExePath": boolean (false)

    Enable this to include any executables in `$PATH`. Suggestions will not include
    aliases, functions nor privates.

    ### "IncFiles": boolean (true)

    Include files and directories. This is enabled by default for any commands
    that don't have autocomplete defined but you will need to manually enable
    it in any `autocomplete` schemas you create and want files as part of the
    suggestions.

    If you want to filter files based on file name then you can set a regexp
    string to match to using **FileRegexp**.

    ### "IncManPage": boolean (false)

    The default behavior for commands with no autocomplete defined is to parse the
    man page and use those results. If a custom autocomplete is defined then that
    man page parser is disabled by default. You can re-enable it and include its
    results with other flags and behaviors you define by using this directive.

    ### "ListView": boolean (false)

    This alters the appearance of the autocompletion suggestions "popup". Rather
    than suggestions being in a grid layout (with descriptions overwriting the
    hint text) the suggestions are in a list view with the descriptions next to
    them on the same row (similar to how an IDE might display it's suggestions).

    ### "NestedCommand": boolean (false)

    Only enable this if the command you are autocompleting is a nested parameter
    of the parent command you have types. For example with `sudo`, once you've
    typed the command name you wish to elivate, then you would want suggestions
    for that command rather than for `sudo` itself.

    ### "Optional": boolean (false)

    Specifies if a match is required for the index in this schema. ie optional
    flags.
  Flags:
    get: output all autocompletion schemas
    set: define a new autocompletion schema
