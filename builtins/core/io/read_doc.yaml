  Detail: |-
    ### Classic usage

    If `read` is called as a method then the prompt string is taken from stdin.
    Otherwise the prompt string will be the first parameter. However if no prompt
    string is given then `read` will not write a prompt.

    The last parameter will be the variable name to store the string read by `read`.
    This variable cannot be prefixed by dollar, `$`, otherwise the shell will write
    the output of that variable as the last parameter rather than the name of the
    variable.

    The data type the `read` line will be stored as is `str` (string). If you
    require this to be different then please use `tread` (typed read) or call `read`
    with the `--datatype` flag as per the **script usage**.
  Flags:
    --prompt: User notification to display
    --variable: "Variable name to store the read data (default: read)"
    --datatype: "Murex data-type for the read data (default: str)"
    --default: If a zero length string is returned but neither `ctrl`+`c` nor `ctrl`+`d`
               were pressed, then the default value defined here will be returned
    --autocomplete: "Autocompletion suggestions. Can be either a JSON array or a JSON object"
    --mask: "Optional password mask, for reading secrets"
