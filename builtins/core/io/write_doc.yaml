  Title: >+
    Write File (Truncate): `>`
  CategoryID: parser
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.fs, parser.pipes ]
  Summary: >-
    Writes stdin to disk - overwriting contents if file already exists
  Description: |-
    Redirects output to file.

    If a file already exists, the contents will be truncated (overwritten).
    Otherwise a new file is created.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> |> [ -i | --ignore-pipeline-check ] filename
   
    <stdin> |> [ -w | --wait-for-eof ] filename
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    g * |> files.txt
    ```
  Flags:
    "--ignore-pipeline-check": >-
      Don't check if _filename_ is a parameter for an earlier command in the pipeline
    "-i": >-
      Alias for `--ignore-pipeline`
    
    "--wait-for-eof": >-
      Wait for stdin to return an EOF before opening _filename_
    "-w": >-
      Alias for `--wait-for-eof`
  Detail: |-
    ### Race Condition Detection

    If no flags are specified, then `|>` will check if the filename supplied is
    used in any parameters for other commands in the pipeline. If it has been, then
    `|>` will wait for an **EOF** (End Of File) from stdin before opening _filename_.

    This is to allow pipelines like the following:

    ```
    open example.log | regexp m/error/ |> example.log
    ```

    Under traditional shells and Murex's normal scheduler, all commands in a
    pipeline would run concurrently. This leads to a race condition where `|>`
    opens (and thus truncates) a file before other commands can read from it.

    However by default, `|>` will check the pipeline to look for any other
    references of _filename_ and if it exists, it will wait for an EOF before
    `|>` truncates _filename_.

    This wait for EOF behaviour can be forced with the `--wait-for-eof` / `-w`
    flag.

    Alternatively, if you want to force `|>` to run concurrently then you can
    disable the pipeline check with the `--ignore-pipeline-check` / `-i` flag.

    #### High Memory Usage

    > WARNING! Waiting for EOF will cause `|>` to cache the pipeline into RAM.
    > If your pipeline is parsing multi-gigabyte or larger files then you may
    > experience performance issues.
    
    For large datasets, it might be preferable to write to a temporary file first.
    
    ```
    open example.log | regexp m/error/ |> example.log.tmp
    mv example.log.tmp example.log
    ```

    The move operation should be instantaneous on most filesystems because your
    operating system will just alter filesystem metadata rather than move the file
    contents.

    ### Flag Without A Filename

    If you specify a flag without a filename, eg `|> --wait-for-eof`, then it is
    assumed that the flag _is_ the filename.

    ### Syntactic Sugar

    While `|>` is referred to as an operator, it's actually a pipe followed by a
    builtin:
    
    ```
    out "foobar" | > example.txt
    ```

    Thus you can actually use `>` by itself.

    ### Creating An Empty File

    If `>` is at the start of a pipeline then it is treated as null input. This a
    convenient shortcut to create an empty file or blank an existing file.

    **Create a new empty file:**

    ```
    > newfile
    ```

    **Clear a large log file without deleting the file itself:**

    ```
    > large.log
    ```

    ### Appending A File

    To append a file (ie write at the end of the file without overwriting its
    contents) use `>>` instead.
  Synonyms:
    - ">"
    - "|>"
    - "fwrite"

  Title: >-
     Write File (Append): `>>`
  CategoryID: parser
  SubCategoryIDs: [ parser.pipes ]
  Summary: >-
    Writes stdin to disk - appending contents if file already exists
  Description: |-
    This is used to redirect the stdout of a command and append it to a file. If
    that file does not exist, then the file is created.

    This behaves similarly to the [Bash (et al) token](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Appending-Redirected-Output)
    except it doesn't support adding alternative file descriptor numbers. Instead
    you will need to use named pipes to achieve the same effect in Murex.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » out "Hello" >> example.txt
    » out "World!" >> example.txt
    » open example.txt
    Hello
    World!
    ```
  Detail: |-
    ### Syntactic Sugar

    This is just syntactic sugar for `-> >>`. Thus when the parser reads code like
    the following:
    
    ```
    out "foobar" >> example.txt
    ```

    it will compile an abstract syntax tree which would reflect the following code
    instead:

    ```
    out "foobar" | >> example.txt
    ```

    ### Truncating A File

    To truncate a file (ie overwrite its contents) use `|>` instead.
