    Regex Matches (`rx`)
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.fs ]
  Summary: >-
    Regexp pattern matching for file system objects (eg `.*\\.txt`)
  Description: |-
    Returns a list of files and directories that match a regexp pattern.

    Output is a JSON list.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    rx pattern -> <stdout>

    !rx pattern -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> rx pattern -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> !rx pattern -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Inline regex file matching
    
    ```
    cat: @{ rx '.*\.txt' }
    ```

    ### Writing a list of files to disk
    
    ```
    rx '.*\.go' |> filelist.txt
    ```

    ### Checking if files exist
    
    ```
    if { rx somefiles.* } then {
        # files exist
    }
    ```

    ### Checking if files do not exist
    
    ```
    !if { rx somefiles.* } then {
        # files do not exist
    }
    ```

    ### Return all files apart from

    ```
    !rx '\.txt$'
    ```

    ### Filtering a file list

    Filtering a file list, returning only files that match the regexp match:

    ```
    f +f -> rx '.*\.txt'
    ```

    Please note that `rx` here is doing an additional check if the file exists.

    ### Remove any regexp file matches

    ```
    f +f -> !rx '.*\.txt'
    ```

    ### Traversing Directories

    Unlike globbing (`g`) which can traverse directories (eg `g /path/*`), `rx` is
    only designed to match file system objects in the current working directory.

    `rx` uses Go (lang)'s standard regexp engine.

    ### Inverse Matches

    If you want to exclude any matches based on wildcards, rather than include
    them, then you can use the bang prefix. eg

    ```
    » rx READ*                                                                                                                                                              
    [
        "README.md"
    ]
    
    murex-dev» !rx .*
    Error in `!rx` (1,1): No data returned.
    ```
    
    ### When Used As A Method

    `!rx` first looks for files that match its pattern, then it reads the file list
    from stdin. If stdin contains contents that are not files then `!rx` might not
    handle those list items correctly. This shouldn't be an issue with `rx` in its
    normal mode because it is only looking for matches however when used as `!rx`
    any items that are not files will leak through.

    This is its designed feature and not a bug. If you wish to remove anything that
    also isn't a file then you should first pipe into either `g *`, `rx .*`, or
    `f +f` and then pipe that into `!rx`.

    The reason for this behavior is to separate this from `!regexp` and `!match`.
