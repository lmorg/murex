    `a` (make array)
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array or list
  Description: |-
    _murex_ has a pretty sophisticated builtin for generating arrays. Think
    like bash's `{1..9}` syntax:

    ```
    a: [1..9]
    ```
  Usage: |-
    ```
    a: [start..end] -> <stdout>
    a: [start..end.base] -> <stdout>
    a: [start..end,start..end] -> <stdout>
    a: [start..end][start..end] -> <stdout>
    ```

    All usages also work with `ja` as well:

    ```
    ja: [start..end] -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » a: [1..3]
    1
    2
    3

    » a: [3..1]
    3
    2
    1

    » a: [01..03]
    01
    02
    03
    ```

    #### Alternative Number Bases

    You can also specify an alternative number base by using an `x` or `.`
    in the end range:

    ```
    a: [00..ffx16]
    a: [00..ff.16]
    ```

    All number bases from 2 (binary) to 36 (0-9 plus a-z) are supported.
    Please note that the start and end range are written in the target base
    while the base identifier is written in decimal: `[hex..hex.dec]`

    Also note that the additional zeros denotes padding (ie the results will
    start at `00`, `01`, etc rather than `0`, `1`...)

    #### Character arrays

    You can select a range of letters (a to z):

    ```
    » a: [a..z]
    » a: [z..a]
    » a: [A..Z]
    » a: [Z..A]
    ```

    ...or any characters within that range.

    #### Special ranges

    Unlike bash, _murex_ also supports some special ranges:

    ```  
    » a: [mon..sun]
    » a: [monday..sunday]
    » a: [jan..dec]
    » a: [janurary..december]
    » a: [spring..winter]
    ```

    It is also case aware. If the ranges are uppercase then the return will
    be uppercase. If the ranges are title case (capital first letter) then
    the return will be in title case:

    ```
    » a: [Monday..Sunday]
    Monday
    Tuesday
    Wednesday
    Thursday
    Friday
    Saturday
    Sunday
    ```

    Where the special ranges differ from a regular range is they cannot
    cannot down. eg `a: [3..1]` would output

    ```
    » a: [3..1]
    3
    2
    1
    ```

    however a negative range in special ranges will cycle through to the end
    of the range and then loop back from the start:

    ```
    » a: [Thursday..Wednesday]
    Thursday
    Friday
    Saturday
    Sunday
    Monday
    Tuesday
    Wednesday
    ```

    This decision was made because generally with ranges of this type, you
    would more often prefer to cycle through values rather than iterate
    backwards through the list.

    If you did want to reverse then just pipe the output into another tool:

    ```
    » a: [Monday..Friday] -> mtac
    Friday
    Thurday
    Wednesday
    Tuesday
    Monday
    ```

    There are other UNIX tools which aren't data type aware but would work in
    this specific scenario:
    * `tac` (Linux),
    * `tail -r` (BSD / OS X)
    * `perl -e "print reverse <>"` (Multiplatform but requires Perl installed)

    #### Advanced Array Syntax

    The syntax for `a` is a comma separated list of parameters with expansions
    stored in square brackets. You can have an expansion embedded inside a
    parameter or as it's own parameter. Expansions can also have multiple
    parameters.

    ```
    » a: 01,02,03,05,06,07
    01
    02
    03
    05
    06
    07
    ```

    ```
    » a: 0[1..3],0[5..7]
    01
    02
    03
    05
    06
    07
    ```
    
    ```
    » a: 0[1..3,5..7]
    01
    02
    03
    05
    06
    07
    ```
    
    ```
    » a: b[o,i]b
    bob
    bib
    ```

    You can also have multiple expansion blocks in a single parameter:

    ```
    » a: a[1..3]b[5..7]
    a1b5
    a1b6
    a1b7
    a2b5
    a2b6
    a2b7
    a3b5
    a3b6
    a3b7
    ```

    `a` will cycle through each iteration of the last expansion, moving itself
    backwards through the string; behaving like an normal counter.

    #### Creating JSON arrays with `ja`

    As you can see from the previous examples, `a` returns the array as a
    list of strings. This is so you can stream excessively long arrays, for
    example every IPv4 address: `a: [0..254].[0..254].[0..254].[0..254]`
    (this kind of array expansion would hang bash).

    However if you needed a JSON string then you can use all the same syntax
    as `a` but forgo the streaming capability:

    ```
    » ja: [Monday..Sunday]
    [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday"
    ]
    ```

    This is particularly useful if you are adding formating that might break
    under `a`'s formatting (which uses the `str` data type).

    A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array
  Description: |-
    _murex_ has a pretty sophisticated builtin for generating JSON arrays.
    It works a little bit like Bash's `{1..9}` syntax but includes a few
    additional nifty features.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    ja: [start..end] -> <stdout>
    ja: [start..end.base] -> <stdout>
    ja: [start..end,start..end] -> <stdout>
    ja: [start..end][start..end] -> <stdout>

  Examples: |-
    ```
    ja: [1..5] 
    [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3",
        "4",
        "5"
    ]
    ```

    » ja: [Monday..Sunday]

        "Thursday",
        "Friday",
        "Saturday",
        "Sunday"
    ]
    ```

    Please note that as per the first example, all arrays generated by `ja` are
    arrays of strings - even if you're command is ranging over integers.

  Description: |-
    _murex_ has a pretty sophisticated builtin for generating arrays. It works
    a little bit like Bash's `{1..9}` syntax but includes a few additional nifty
    features and the output format is user defined.

    ```

    Please note that as per the first example, all arrays generated by `ta` are
    arrays of strings - even if you're command is ranging over integers. Also
    if you are only creating arrays in JSON then you could use `ja` instead.
