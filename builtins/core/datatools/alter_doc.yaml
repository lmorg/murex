    Alter Data Structure (`alter`)
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.struct ]
  Summary: >-
    Change a value within a structured data-type and pass that change along the
    pipeline without altering the original source input
  Description: |-
    `alter` a value within a structured data-type.

    The path separator is defined by the first character in the path. For example
    `/path/to/key`, `,path,to,key`, `|path|to|key` and `#path#to#key` are all valid
    however you should remember to quote or escape any special characters (tokens)
    used by the shell (such as pipe, `|`, and hash, `#`).

    The **value** must always be supplied as JSON.

    > When working with expressions, you may find the **Assign or Merge** operator
    > more ergonomic ({{link "read more" "assign-or-merge"}}) 
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> alter [ -m | --merge | -s | --sum ] /path value -> <stdout>

    <stdin> ~> value -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Altering an objects value

    ```
    » config -> [ shell ] -> [ prompt ] -> alter /Value moo
    {
        "Data-Type": "block",
        "Default": "{ out 'murex » ' }",
        "Description": "Interactive shell prompt.",
        "Value": "moo"
    }
    ```

    ### Inserting JSON

    `alter` also accepts JSON as a parameter for adding structured data:

    ```
    config -> [ shell ] -> [ prompt ] -> alter /Example { "Foo": "Bar" }
    {
        "Data-Type": "block",
        "Default": "{ out 'murex » ' }",
        "Description": "Interactive shell prompt.",
        "Example": {
            "Foo": "Bar"
        },
        "Value": "{ out 'murex » ' }"
    }
    ```

    ### Data-type aware

    It is also data type aware so if they key you're updating holds a string
    (for example) then the JSON data a will be stored as a string:

    ```
    » config -> [ shell ] -> [ prompt ] -> alter /Value { "Foo": "Bar" }
    {
        "Data-Type": "block",
        "Default": "{ out 'murex » ' }",
        "Description": "Interactive shell prompt.",
        "Value": "{ \"Foo\": \"Bar\" }"
    }
    ```

    Numbers will also follow the same transparent conversion treatment:

    ```
    » tout json { "one": 1, "two": 2 } -> alter /two "3"
    {
        "one": 1,
        "two": 3
    }
    ```

    > Please note: `alter` is not changing the value held inside `config` but
    > instead took the stdout from `config`, altered a value and then passed that
    > new complete structure through it's stdout.
    >
    > If you require modifying a structure inside Murex config (such as http
    > headers) then you can use `config alter`. Read the config docs for reference.
  
    ### -m / --merge

    Thus far all the examples have be changing existing keys. However you can also
    alter a structure by appending to an array or a merging two maps together. You
    do this with the `--merge` (or `-m`) flag.

    ```
    » out a\nb\nc -> alter --merge / ([ "d", "e", "f" ])
    a
    b
    c
    d
    e
    f
    ```

    ### -s / --sum

    This behaves similarly to `--merge` where structures are blended together.
    However where a map exists with two keys the same and the values are numeric,
    those values are added together.

    ```
    » tout json { "a": 1, "b": 2 } -> alter --sum / { "b": 3, "c": 4 }
    {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 5,
        "c": 4
    }
    ```
  Detail: |-
    ### Path

    The path parameter can take any character as node separators. The separator is
    assigned via the first character in the path. For example

    ```
    config -> alter .shell.prompt.Value moo
    config -> alter >shell>prompt>Value moo
    ```

    Just make sure you quote or escape any characters used as shell tokens. eg

    ```
    config -> alter '#shell#prompt#Value' moo
    config -> alter ' shell prompt Value' moo
    ```

    ### Supported data-types

    The *value* field must always be supplied as JSON however the *stdin* struct
    can be any data-type supported by murex.
    
    You can check what data-types are available via the `runtime` command:

    ```
    runtime --marshallers
    ```

    Marshallers are enabled at compile time from the `builtins/data-types` directory.

    ### Alter operator

    `~>` is a synonym for `alter --merge /`, for example:

    ```
    » tout json %[1 2 3] ~> %[4 5 6]
    [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5,
        6
    ]
    ```
  Flags:
    "--merge": Merge data structures rather than overwrite
    "-m"     : Alias for `--merge`
    "--sum"  : Sum values in a map, merge items in an array
    "-s"     : Alias for `--sum`

    - alter
