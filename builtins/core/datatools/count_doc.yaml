  Summary: >-
    Count items in a map, list or array
  Description: |-

  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> count: [ --merge | --sum | --total ] -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Count number of items in a map, list or array:

    ```
    » tout: json (["a", "b", "c"]) -> count 
    3
    ```
  Detail: |-
    ### Modes

    If no flags are set, `count` will default to using `--total`.

    #### Total: `--total` / `-t`

    This will read an array, list or map from STDIN and output the length for
    that array.

    ```
    » a [25-Dec-2020..05-Jan-2021] -> count 
    12
    ```

    > This also replaces the older `len` method.

    Please note that this returns the length of the _array_ rather than string.
    For example `out "foobar" -> count` would return `1` because an array in the
    `str` data type would be new line separated (eg `out "foo\nbar" -> count`
    would return `2`). If you need to count characters in a string and are
    running POSIX (eg Linux / BSD / OSX) then it is recommended to use `wc`
    instead. But be mindful that `wc` will also count new line characters.

    ```
    » out: "foobar" -> count
    1

    » out: "foo\nbar" -> count
    2

    » out: "foobar" -> wc: -c
    7

    » out: "foo\nbar" -> wc: -c
    8

    » printf: "foobar" -> wc: -c
    6
    # (printf does not print a trailing new line)
    ```

    #### Duplications: `--duplications` / `-d`

    This returns a JSON map of items and the number of their occurrences in a list
    or array.

    For example in the quote below, only the word "the" is repeated so that entry
    will have a value of `2` while ever other entry has a value of `1` because they
    only appear once in the quote.

    ```
    » out: "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit: \s -> count: --duplications
    {
        "brown": 1,
        "dog": 1,
        "fox": 1,
        "jumped": 1,
        "lazy": 1,
        "over": 1,
        "quick": 1,
        "the": 2
    }
    ```

    #### Unique: `--unique` / `-u`

    Returns the number of unique elements in a list or array.

    For example in the quote below, only the word "the" is repeated, thus the
    unique count should be one less than the total count:

    ```
    » out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --unique
    8
    » out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --total
    9
    ```
