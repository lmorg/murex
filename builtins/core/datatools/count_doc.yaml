  Summary: >-
    Count items in a map, list or array
  Description: |-
    Counts the number of items in a structure, be that a list, map or other object
    type.

    `count` has several modes ranging from updating values in place, returning new
    structures, or just outputting totals.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> count [ --duplications | --unique | --total ] -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Count number of items in a map, list or array:

    ```
    » tout json (["a", "b", "c"]) -> count 
    3
    ```
  Detail: |-
    If no flags are set, `count` will default to using `--total`.

    ### Total: `--total` / `-t`

    This will read an array, list or map from stdin and output the length for
    that array.

    ```
    » a [25-Dec-2020..05-Jan-2021] -> count 
    12
    ```

    > This also replaces the older `len` method.

    Please note that this returns the length of the _array_ rather than string.
    For example `out "foobar" -> count` would return `1` because an array in the
    `str` data type would be new line separated (eg `out "foo\nbar" -> count`
    would return `2`). If you need to count characters in a string and are
    running POSIX (eg Linux / BSD / OSX) then it is recommended to use `wc`
    instead. But be mindful that `wc` will also count new line characters.

    ```
    » out "foobar" -> count
    1

    » out "foo\nbar" -> count
    2

    » out "foobar" -> wc: -c
    7

    » out "foo\nbar" -> wc: -c
    8

    » printf "foobar" -> wc: -c
    6
    # (printf does not print a trailing new line)
    ```

    ### Duplications: `--duplications` / `-d`

    This returns a JSON map of items and the number of their occurrences in a list
    or array.

    For example in the quote below, only the word "the" is repeated so that entry
    will have a value of `2` while ever other entry has a value of `1` because they
    only appear once in the quote.

    ```
    » out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --duplications
    {
        "brown": 1,
        "dog": 1,
        "fox": 1,
        "jumped": 1,
        "lazy": 1,
        "over": 1,
        "quick": 1,
        "the": 2
    }
    ```

    ### Unique: `--unique` / `-u`

    Returns the number of unique elements in a list or array.

    For example in the quote below, only the word "the" is repeated, thus the
    unique count should be one less than the total count:

    ```
    » out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --unique
    8
    » out "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" -> jsplit \s -> count --total
    9
    ```
  Flags:
    "--duplications": >-
        Output a JSON map of items and the number of their occurrences in a list or array
    "-d": >- 
        Alias for `--duplications`
    
    "--unique": >-

    "-u": >-
        Alias for `--unique`
    
    "--sum": >-
        Read an array, list or map from stdin and output the sum of all the values (ignore non-numeric values)
    "-s": >-
        Alias for `--sum`
    "--sum-strict": >-
        Read an array, list or map from stdin and output the sum of all the values (error on non-numeric values)

    "--total": >-
