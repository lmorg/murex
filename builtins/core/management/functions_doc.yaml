  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Debugging information
  Description: |-
    `debug` has two modes: as a function and as a method.

    ### Debug Method

    This usage will return debug information about the previous function ran.

    ### Debug Function:

    This will enable or disable debugging mode.

  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> debug -> <stdout>
    
    debug: boolean -> <stdout>
    
    debug -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Return debugging information on the previous function:

    ```
    » echo: "hello, world!" -> debug

    ```

    Enable or disable debug mode:

    ```
    » debug: on
    true

    » debug: off
    false
    ```

    Output whether debug mode is enabled or disabled:
    
    ```
    » debug
    false
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    When enabling or disabling debug mode, because the parameter is a murex
    boolean type, it means you can use other boolean terms. eg

    ```
    # enable debugging
    » debug 1
    » debug on
    » debug yes
    » debug true

    # disable debugging
    » debug 0
    » debug off
    » debug no
    » debug false
    ```

    It is also worth noting that the debugging information needs to be written
    into the Go source code rather than in Murex's shell scripting language.
    If you require debugging those processes then please use Murex's `test`
    framework

  Description: |-
    Output the auto-detected OS name.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    os -> <stdout>

    os string -> <stdout>
    ``` 
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » os
    linux
    ```

    Or if you want to check if the host is one of a number of platforms:

    ```
    # When run on Linux or FreeBSD
    » os linux freebsd
    true

    # When run on another platform, eg Windows or Darwin (OSX)
    # (exit number would also be `1`)
    » os linux freebsd
    false
    ```

    `posix` is also supported:

    ```
    # When run on Linux, FreeBSD or Darwin (for example)
    » os posix
    true

    # When run on Windows or Plan 9
    # (exit number would also be `1`)
    » os posix
    false
    ```

    Please note that although Plan 9 shares similarities with POSIX, it is not
    POSIX-compliant. For that reason, `os` returns false with the `posix`
    parameter when run on Plan 9. If you want to include Plan 9 in the check
    then please write it as `os posix plan9`.

    `murex-update-exe-list`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Forces Murex to rescan $PATH looking for executables
  Description: |-
    On application launch, Murex scans and caches all the executables found in
    $PATH on your host. Murex then does regular scans there after. However if
    you want to force a new scan (for example you've just installed a new
    program and you want it to appear in tab completion) then you can run `murex-update-exe-list`.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    murex-update-exe-list
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » murex-update-exe-list
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    Murex will automatically update the exe list each time tab completion is
    invoked for command name completion via the REPL shell.

    `cd`

  Summary: >-
    Change (working) directory
  Description: |-
    Changes current working directory.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    cd [path]
    ```
  Examples: |-
    **Home directory:**
    
    ```
    » cd: ~
    ```

    Including `cd` without a parameter will also change to the current user's home
    directory:

    ```
    » cd
    ```

    **Absolute path:**
    
    ```
    » cd: /etc/
    ```

    **Relative path:**

    ```
    » cd: Documents
    » cd: ./Documents
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    `cd` updates an environmental variable, `$PWDHIST` with an array of paths.
    You can then use that to change to a previous directory.

    **View the working directory history:**
    
    ```
    » $PWDHIST
    ```

    **Change to a previous directory:**
    
    ```
    » cd $PWDHIST[-1]
    ```

    ### auto-cd

    Some people prefer to omit `cd` and just write the path, with their shell
    automatically changing to that directory if the "command" is just a directory.
    In Murex you can enable this behaviour by turning on "auto-cd":

    ```
    config: set shell auto-cd true
    ```

  Summary: >-
    Check which builtins exist
  Description: |-
    `bexists` takes an array of parameters and returns which commands have been
    compiled into Murex. The 'b' in `bexists` stands for 'builtins'
  Usage: |-
    ```
    bexists command... -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » bexists: qr gzip runtime config
    {
        "Installed": [

            "config"

            "qr",
            "gzip"
        ]
    }
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    This builtin dates back to the start of Murex when all of the builtins were
    considered optional. This was intended to be a way for scripts to determine
    which builtins were compiled. Since then `runtime` has absorbed and centralized
    a number of similar commands which have since been deprecated. The same fate
    might also happen to `bexists` however it is in use by a few modules and for
    that reason alone it has been spared from the axe.
