    Locate command origin
  Description: |-
   `which` locates a command's origin. If stdout is a TTY, then it's output will be
   human readable. If stdout is a pipe then it's output will be a simple list.

   `which` can take multiple parameters, each representing a different command you
   want looked up.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    which command... -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### TTY output

    ```
    » which cat dog jobs git dug
    cat => (/bin/cat) cat - concatenate and print files
    dog => unknown
    jobs => (alias) fid-list --jobs => (builtin) Lists all running functions within the current Murex session
    git => (/opt/homebrew/bin/git -> ../Cellar/git/2.41.0/bin/git) git - the stupid content tracker
    dug => (murex function) A bit like dig but which outputs JSON
    ```

    ### Piped output

    ```
    » which cat dog jobs git dug -> cat
    /bin/cat
    unknown
    alias
    /opt/homebrew/bin/git
    function
    ```
