  Summary: >-
    Reverse the order of an array
  Description: |-
    `mtac` takes input from STDIN and reverses the order of it.

    It's name is derived from a program called `tac` - a tool that functions
    like `cat` but returns the contents in the reverse order. The difference
    with the `mtac` builtin is that it is data-type aware. So it doesn't just
    function as a replacement for `tac` but it also works on JSON arrays,
    s-expressions, and any other data-type supporting arrays compiled into
    _murex_. 
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> mtac -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » ja: [Monday..Friday] -> mtac
    [
        "Friday",
        "Thursday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Monday"
    ]

    # Normal output (without mtac)
    » ja: [Monday..Friday]
    [
        "Monday",
        "Tuesday",
        "Wednesday",
        "Thursday",
        "Friday"
    ]
    ```

  Detail: |-
    Please bare in mind that while _murex_ is optimised with concurrency and
    streaming in mind, it's impossible to reverse an incomplete array. Thus all
    all of STDIN must have been read and that file closed before `mtac` can
    output.

    In practical terms you shouldn't notice any difference except for when
    STDIN is a long running process or non-standard stream (eg network pipe).
