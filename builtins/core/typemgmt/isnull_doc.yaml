    Checks if a variable is null or undefined
  Description: |-
    `is-null` checks if a variable is null or undefined. If multiple variables are
    passed in `is-null`'s parameters, the exit number will be a count of the number
    of non-null variables checked.

    `is-null` is intended to be run non-interactively, where it doesn't write to
    stdout but instead communicates its results via exit number. However if stdout
    is a TTY `is-null` will additionally write to the terminal.

    The following conditions are considered "null" by `is-null`:

    * a variable not being defined
    * a property not existed, eg an object key or array index
    * any other error reading from a variable
    * or the value of the variable or property being the data-type `null` or a
      value of null.

    Zero length strings, strings containing the word "null" and numeric data types
    (eg `num`, `int`, `float` with the value of `0`) are all **not null**.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    is-null variable_name... -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Interactive output

    ```
    » $baz = ""
    » is-null foo bar baz
    foo: undefined or null
    bar: undefined or null
    baz: defined and not null
    ```

    ### None interactive output

    ```
    if { is-null foobar } then {
        out "baz is undefined"
    }
    ```
