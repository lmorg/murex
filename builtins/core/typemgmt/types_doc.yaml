    `exec`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Runs an executable
  Description: |-
    With _murex_, like most other shells, you launch a process by calling the
    name of that executable directly. While this is suitable 99% of the time,
    occasionally you might run into an edge case where that wouldn't work. The
    primary reason being if you needed to launch a process from a variable, eg

    ```
    » set exe=uname
    » $exe
    uname
    ```

    As you can see here, _murex_'s behavior here is to output the contents of
    the variable rather then executing the contents of the variable. This is
    done for safety reasons, however if you wanted to override that behavior
    then you could prefix the variable with exec:

    ```
    » set exe=uname
    » exec $exe
    Linux
    ```
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> exec
    <stdin> -> exec -> <stdout>
               exec -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » exec printf "Hello, world!"
    Hello, world!
    ```

  Detail: |-
    If any command doesn't exist as a builtin, function nor alias, then _murex_
    will default to forking out to any command with this name (subject to an
    absolute path or the order of precedence in `$PATH`). Any forked process will
    show up in both the operating systems process viewer (eg `ps`) but also
    _murex_'s own process viewer, `fid-list`. However inside `fid-list` you will
    notice that all external processes are listed as `exec` with the process name
    as part of `exec`'s parameters. That is because that is literally how _murex_
    handles any programs that aren't native to _murex_.

    Exit murex
  Description: |-
    Exit's _murex_ with either a exit number of 0 (by default if no parameters
    supplied) or a custom value specified by the first parameter.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    exit

- DocumentID: devnull
  Title: >+
    `null`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    null function. Similar to /dev/null
  Description: |-
    `null` is a function that acts a little like the `null` data type and the
    UNIX /dev/null device.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> null
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » out: "Hello, world!" -> null
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    While this method does exist, a more idiomatic way to suppress STDOUT is to
    use the named pipe property rather than piping to null:

    ```
    » out: <null> "Hello, world!"
    ```

  - "null"

    Returns a `true` value
  Description: |-
    Returns a `true` value.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    true -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    By default, `true` also outputs the term "true":

    ```
    » true
    true
    ```

    However you can suppress that with the silent flag:

    ```
    » true -s
    ```

  Title: >+
    `cast`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Alters the data type of the previous function without altering it's output
  Description: |-
    `cast` works a little like when you case variables in lower level languages
    where the value of the variable is unchanged. In _murex_ the contents in
    the pipeline are preserved however the reported data type is altered.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> cast data-type -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » out: {"Array":[1,2,3],"Map":{"String": "Foobar","Number":123.456}} -> cast json
    {"Array":[1,2,3],"Map":{"String": "Foobar","Number":123.456}}
    ```

    If you want to reformat the STDIN into the new data type then use `format`
    instead.
