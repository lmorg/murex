  Summary: >-
    Random field generator
  Description: |-
    `rand` can generate random numbers, strings and other data types.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    rand data-type [ max-value ]
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Specifying data-type

    Random integer (64-bit on 64-bit machines):

    ```
    rand int
    ```

    ### Specifying custom range

    Random integer between 0 and 9:

    ```
    rand int 9
    ```

    Random floating point number between 0 and 1:

    ```
    rand float
    ```

    Random string, fixed to 5 characters long:

    ```
    rand str 5
    ```
  Flags:
    int: Random integer, **max-value** specifies highest value for integer
    num: Alias for **int** in this builtin
    float: Random floating point number between 0 and 1. **max-value** not supported
    str:
      Random string of printable ASCII characters. **max-value** specifies the
      fixed length of the string
    "*": Alias for **str** (string)

    ### Security

    WARNING: is should be noted that while `rand` can produce random numbers and
    strings which might be useful for password generation, neither the RNG nor the
    the random string generator (which is ostensibly the same RNG but applied to an
    array of bytes within the range of printable ASCII characters) are considered
    cryptographically secure.
