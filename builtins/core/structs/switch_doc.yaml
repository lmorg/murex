    Switch Conditional (`switch`)

  Summary: >-
    Blocks of cascading conditionals
  Description: |-
    `switch` is a large block for simplifying cascades of conditional statements.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    switch [value] {
      case | if { conditional } [then] { code-block }
      case | if { conditional } [then] { code-block }
      ...
      [ default { code-block } ]
    } -> <stdout>
    ```

    The first parameter should be either **case** or **if** -- the statements are
    subtly different and thus alter the behavior of `switch`.
    
    **then** is optional ('then' is assumed even if not explicitly present).
  Examples: |-
    Output an array of editors installed:

    ```
    switch {
        if { which vi    } { out vi    }
        if { which vim   } { out vim   }
        if { which nano  } { out nano  }
        if { which emacs } { out emacs }
    } -> format: json
    ```

    A higher/lower game written using `switch`:

    ```
    function higherlower {
      try {
        rand int 100 -> set rand
        while { $rand } {
          read guess "Guess a number between 1 and 100: "

          switch {
            case: { = $guess < $rand } then {
              out "Too low"
            }

            case: { = $guess > $rand } then {
              out "Too high"
            }

            default: {
              out "Correct"
              let rand=0
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    String matching with `switch`:

    ```
    read name "What is your name? "
    switch $name {
        case "Tom"   { out "I have a brother called Tom" }
        case "Dick"  { out "I have an uncle called Dick" }
        case "Sally" { out "I have a sister called Sally" }
        default      { err "That is an odd name" }
    }
    ```

    ### Comparing Values vs Boolean State

    #### By Values

    If you supply a value with `switch`...

    ```
    switch value { ... }
    ```

    ...then all the conditionals are compared against that value. For example:

    ```
    switch foo {
        case bar {
            # not executed because foo != bar
        }
        case foo {
            # executed because foo != foo
        }
    }
    ```

    You can use code blocks to return strings too

    ```
    switch foo {
        case {out bar} then {
            # not executed because foo != bar
        }
        case {out foo} then {
            # executed because foo != foo
        }
    }
    ```

    #### By Boolean State

    This style of syntax could be argued as a prettier counterpart to if/else if.
    Only code blocks are support and each block is checked for its boolean state
    rather than string matching.

    This is simply written as:

    ```
    switch { ... }
    ```

    ### When To Use `case`, `if` and `default`?
    
    A `switch` command may contain multiple **case** and **if** blocks. These
    statements subtly alter the behavior of `switch`. You can mix and match **if**
    and **case** statements within the same `switch` block.
    
    #### case

    A **case** statement will only move on to the next statement if the result of
    the **case** statement is **false**. If a **case** statement is **true** then
    `switch` will exit with an exit number of `0`.

    ```
    switch {
        case { false } then {
            # ignored because case == false
        }
        case { true } then {
            # executed because case == true
        }
        case { true } then {
            # ignored because a previous case was true
        }
    }
    ```

    ### if

    An **if** statement will proceed to the next statement _even_ if the result of
    the **if** statement is **true**.

    ```
    switch {
        if { false } then {
            # ignored because if == false
        }
        if { true } then {
            # executed because if == true
        }
        if { true } then {
            # executed because if == true
        }
    }
    ```

    ### default

    **default** statements are only run if _all_ **case** _and_ **if** statements are
    false.

    ```
    switch {
        if { false } then {
            # ignored because if == false
        }
        if { true } then {
            # executed because if == true
        }
        if { true } then {
            # executed because if == true
        }
        if { false } then {
            # ignored because if == false
        }
        default {
            # ignored because one or more previous if's were true
        }
    }
    ```

    > **default** was added in Murex version 3.1

    ### catch

    **catch** has been deprecated in version 3.1 and replaced with **default**.
