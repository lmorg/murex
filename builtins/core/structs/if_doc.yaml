    If Conditional (`if`)
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.lang ]
  Summary: >-
    Conditional statement to execute different blocks of code depending on the
    result of the condition
  Description: |-
    Conditional control flow

    `if` can be utilized both as a method as well as a standalone function. As a
    method, the conditional state is derived from the calling function (eg if the
    previous function succeeds then the condition is `true`).
  Usage: |-
    ### Function `if`:

    ```
    if { code-block } then {
        # true
    } else {
        # false
    }
    ```

    ### Method `if`

    ```
    command -> if {
        # true
    } else {
        # false
    }
    ```

    ### Negative Function `if`:

    ```
    !if { code-block } then {
        # false
    }
    ```

    ### Negative Method `if`:

    ```
    command -> !if {
        # false
    }
    ```

    ### Please Note:
    the `then` and `else` statements are optional. So the first usage could
    also be written as:

    ```
    if { code-block } {
        # true
    } {
        # false
    }
    ```

    However the practice of omitting those statements isn't recommended beyond
    writing short one liners in the interactive command prompt.
  Examples: |-
    Check if a file exists:

    ```
    if { g somefile.txt } then {
        out "File exists"
    }
    ```

    ...or does not exist (both ways are valid):

    ```
    !if { g somefile.txt } then {
        out "File does not exist"
    }
    ```

    ```
    if { g somefile.txt } else {
        out "File does not exist"
    }
    ```

    ### Pipelines and Output

    The conditional block can contain entire pipelines - even multiple lines of code
    let alone a single pipeline - as well as solitary commands as demonstrated in
    the examples above. However the conditional block does not output stdout nor
    stderr to the rest of the pipeline so you don't have to worry about redirecting
    the output streams to `null`.

    If you require output from the conditional blocks stdout then you will need to
    use either a Murex named pipe to redirect the output, or test or debug flags
    (depending on your use case) if you only need to occasionally inspect the
    conditionals output.

    ### Exit Numbers

    When evaluating a command or code block, `if` will treat an exit number less
    than 0 as true, and one greater than 0 as false. When the exit number is 0, `if`
    will examine the stdout of the command or code block. If there is no output, or
    the output is one of the following strings, `if` will evaluate the command or
    code block as false. Otherwise, it will be considered true.

    * `0`
    * `disabled`
    * `fail`
    * `failed`
    * `false`
    * `no`
    * `null`
    * `off`
