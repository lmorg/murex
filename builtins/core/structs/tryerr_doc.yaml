    Stderr Checking In TTY (`tryerr`)
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.err ]
  Summary: >-
    Handles errors inside a block of code
  Description: |-
    `tryerr` forces a different execution behavior where a failed process at the end
    of a pipeline will cause the block to terminate regardless of any functions that
    might follow.

    It's usage is similar to try blocks in other languages (eg Java) but a closer
    functional example would be `set -e` in Bash.

    To maintain concurrency within the pipeline, `tryerr` will only check the last
    function in any given pipeline (ie series of functions joined via `|`, `->`, or
    similar operators). If you need the entire pipeline checked then use `trypipe`.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    tryerr { code-block } -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> tryerr { -> code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    tryerr {
        out "Hello, World!" -> grep: "non-existent string"
        out "This command will be ignored"
    }
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    A failure is determined by:

    * Any process that returns a non-zero exit number
    * Any process that returns more output via stderr than it does via stdout

    You can see which run mode your functions are executing under via the `fid-list`
    command.

  Title: >+
    Stderr Checking In Pipes (`trypipeerr`)
  CategoryID: commands
  SubCategoryIDs: [ commands.err ]
  Summary: >-
    Checks state of each function in a pipeline and exits block on error
  Description: |-
    `trypipeerr` checks the state of each function and exits the block if any of them
    fail. Where `trypipeerr` differs from regular `tryerr` blocks is `trypipeerr` will
    check every process along the pipeline as well as the terminating function (which
    `tryerr` only validates against). The downside to this is that piped functions can
    no longer run in parallel.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    trypipeerr { code-block } -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> trypipeerr { -> code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    trypipeerr {
        out "Hello, World!" -> grep: "non-existent string" -> cat
        out "This command will be ignored"
    }
    ```

    Formated pager (`less`) where the pager isn't called if the formatter (`pretty`) fails (eg input isn't valid JSON):

    ```
    func pless {
        -> trypipeerr { -> pretty -> less }
    }
    ```
