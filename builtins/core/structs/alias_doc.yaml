  Summary: >-
    Create an alias for a command
  Description: |-
    `alias` allows you to create a shortcut or abbreviation for a longer command.

    IMPORTANT: aliases in Murex are not macros and are therefore different than
     other shells. if the shortcut requires any dynamics such as `piping`,
     `command sequencing`, `variable evaluations` or `scripting`...
     Prefer the **`function`** builtin.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    alias [ --copy | -c ] alias=command parameter parameter ...

    !alias command
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Because aliases are parsed into an array of parameters, you cannot put the
    entire alias within quotes. For example:

    ```
    # bad :(
    » alias hw="out Hello, World!"
    » hw
    exec "out\\ Hello,\\ World!": executable file not found in $PATH

    # good :)
    » alias hw=out "Hello, World!"
    » hw
    Hello, World!
    ```

    Notice how only the command `out "Hello, World!"` is quoted in `alias` the
    same way you would have done if you'd run that command "naked" in the command
    line? This is how `alias` expects it's parameters and where `alias` on Murex
    differs from `alias` in POSIX shells.

    To materialize those differences, pay attention to the examples below:

    ```
    # bad : the following statements generate errors,
    #  prefer function builtin to implent them

    » alias myalias=out "Hello, World!" | wc
    » alias myalias=out $myvariable | wc
    » alias myalias=out ${vmstat} | wc
    » alias myalias=out "hello" && out "world"
    » alias myalias=out "hello" ; out "world"
    » alias myalias="out hello; out world"
    ```

    In some ways this makes `alias` a little less flexible than it might
    otherwise be. However the design of this is to keep `alias` focused on it's
    core objective. To implement the above aliasing, you can use `function`
    instead.
  Flags:
    --copy: >-
      copies `method`, `summary` and `autocomplete` of destination command.
      `autocomplete` is only copied if alias does not include parameters.

    ### Allowed characters

    Alias names can only include alpha-numeric characters, hyphen and underscore.
    The following regex is used to validate the `alias`'s parameters:
    `^([-_a-zA-Z0-9]+)=(.*?)$`

    ### Undefining an alias

    Like all other definable states in Murex, you can delete an alias with the
    bang prefix:

    ```
    » alias hw=out "Hello, World!"
    » hw
    Hello, World!

    » !alias hw
    » hw
    exec "hw": executable file not found in $PATH
    ```
