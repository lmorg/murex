    `try`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Handles errors inside a block of code
  Description: |-
    `try` forces a different execution behavior where a failed process at the end
    of a pipeline will cause the block to terminate regardless of any functions that
    might follow.

    It's usage is similar to try blocks in other languages (eg Java) but a closer
    functional example would be `set -e` in Bash.

    To maintain concurrency within the pipeline, `try` will only check the last
    function in any given pipeline (ie series of functions joined via `|`, `->`, or
    similar operators). If you need the entire pipeline checked then use `trypipe`.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    try { code-block } -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> try { -> code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    try {
        out: "Hello, World!" -> grep: "non-existent string"
        out: "This command will be ignored"
    }
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    A failure is determined by:

    * Any process that returns a non-zero exit number
    * Any process that returns more output via STDERR than it does via STDOUT

    You can see which run mode your functions are executing under via the `fid-list`
    command.

  Title: >+
    `trypipe`
  CategoryID: commands 
  Summary: >-
    Checks state of each function in a pipeline and exits block on error
  Description: |-
    `trypipe` checks the state of each function and exits the block if any of them
    fail. Where `trypipe` differs from regular `try` blocks is `trypipe` will check
    every process along the pipeline as well as the terminating function (which
    `try` only validates against). The downside to this is that piped functions can
    no longer run in parallel.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    trypipe { code-block } -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> trypipe { -> code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    trypipe {
        out: "Hello, World!" -> grep: "non-existent string" -> cat
        out: "This command will be ignored"
    }
    ```

    Formated pager (`less`) where the pager isn't called if the formatter (`pretty`) fails (eg input isn't valid JSON):

    ```
    func pless {
        -> trypipe { -> pretty -> less }
    }
    ```

  Title: >+
    `catch`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Handles the exception code raised by `try` or `trypipe` 
  Description: |-
    `catch` is designed to be used in conjunction with `try` and `trypipe` as it
    handles the exceptions raised by the aforementioned.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    [ try | trypipe ] { code-block } -> <stdout>

    catch { code-block } -> <stdout>
    
    !catch { code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    try {
        out: "Hello, World!" -> grep: "non-existent string"
        out: "This command will be ignored"
    }

    catch {
        out: "An error was caught"
    }

    !catch {
        out: "No errors were raised"
    }
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    `catch` can be used with a bang prefix to check for a lack of errors.

    `catch` forwards on the STDIN and exit number of the calling function.
