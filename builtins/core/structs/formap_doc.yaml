  Summary: >-
    Iterate through a map or other collection of data
  Description: |-
    `formap` is a generic tool for iterating through a map, table or other
    sequences of data similarly like a `foreach`. In fact `formap` can even be
    used on array too.

    Unlike `foreach`, `formap`'s default output is `str`, so each new line will be
    treated as a list item. This behaviour will differ if any additional flags are
    used with `foreach`, such as `--jmap`.
  Usage: |-
    `formap` writes a list:

    ```
    <stdin> -> foreach variable { code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```

    `formap` writes to a buffered JSON map:

    ```
    <stdin> -> formap --jmap key value { code-block (map key) } { code-block (map value) } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    First of all lets assume the following dataset:

    ```
    set json people={
        "Tom": {
            "Age": 32,
            "Gender": "Male"
        },
        "Dick": {
            "Age": 43,
            "Gender": "Male"
        },
        "Sally": {
            "Age": 54,
            "Gender": "Female"
        }
    }
    ```

    We can create human output from this:

    ```
    » $people -> formap key value { out "$key is $value[Age] years old" }
    Sally is 54 years old
    Tom is 32 years old
    Dick is 43 years old
    ```

    > Please note that maps are intentionally unsorted so you cannot guarantee the
    > order of the output produced even if the input has been superficially set in
    > a specific order.

    With `--jmap` we can turn that structure into a new structure:

    ```
    » $people -> formap --jmap key value { $key } { $value[Age] }
    {
        "Dick": "43",
        "Sally": "54",
        "Tom": "32"
    } 
    ```
  Flags:
    --jmap: >-
      Write a `json` map to stdout instead of an array
  Detail: |-
    `formap` can also work against arrays and tables as well. However `foreach` is
    a much better tool for ordered lists and tables can look a little funky when
    when there are more than 2 columns. In those instances you're better off using
    `[` (index) to specify columns and then `tabulate` for any data transformation.
