    `alias`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Create an alias for a command
  Description: |-
    `alias` defines an alias for global usage
  Usage: |-
    ```
    alias: alias=command parameter parameter

    !alias: command
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Because aliases are parsed into an array of parameters, you cannot put the
    entire alias within quotes. For example:

    ```
    # bad :(
    » alias hw="out Hello, World!"
    » hw
    exec: "out\\ Hello,\\ World!": executable file not found in $PATH
    
    # good :)
    » alias hw=out "Hello, World!"
    » hw
    Hello, World!
    ```

    Notice how only the command `out "Hello, World!"` is quoted in `alias` the
    same way you would have done if you'd run that command "naked" in the command
    line? This is how `alias` expects it's parameters and where `alias` on _murex_
    differs from `alias` in POSIX shells.

    In some ways this makes `alias` a little less flexible than it might
    otherwise be. However the design of this is to keep `alias` focused on it's
    core objective. For any more advanced requirements you can use a `function`
    instead.

    #### Allowed characters

    Alias names can only include alpha-numeric characters, hyphen and underscore.
    The following regex is used to validate the `alias`'s parameters:
    `^([-_a-zA-Z0-9]+)=(.*?)$`

    #### Undefining an alias

    Like all other definable states in _murex_, you can delete an alias with the
    bang prefix:

    ```
    » alias hw=out "Hello, World!"
    » hw
    Hello, World!

    » !alias hw
    » hw
    exec: "hw": executable file not found in $PATH
    ```

    #### Order of preferece

    There is an order of preference for which commands are looked up:
    1. aliases (all aliases are global)
    2. murex functions (all `functions`s are global)
    3. private functions (`privates` cannot be global and are scoped only to
       the module or source that defined them. You cannot call a private
       function from the interactive command line)
    4. variables (dollar prefixed)
    5. auto-globbing prefix: `@g`
    6. murex builtins
    7. external executables

  - alias
  - "!alias"

    Define a function block
  Description: |-
    `function` defines a block of code as a function
  Usage: |-
    ```
    function: name { code-block }

    !function: command
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » function hw { out "Hello, World!" }
    » hw
    Hello, World!

    » hw

    #### Allowed characters

    Function names can only include any characters apart from dollar (`$`).
    This is to prevent functions from overwriting variables (see the order of
    preference below).

  Title: >+
    `private`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Define a private function block
  Description: |-
    `private` defines a function who's scope is limited to that module or source
    file.
    
    Privates cannot be called from one module to another (unless they're wrapped
    around a global `function`) and nor can they be called from the interactive
    command line. The purpose of a `private` is to reduce repeated code inside
    a module or source file without cluttering up the global namespace.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    private: name { code-block }
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    # The following cannot be entered via the command line. You need to write
    # it to a file and execute it from there.

    private hw {
        out "Hello, World!"
    }
    
    function tom {
        hw
        out "My name is Tom."
    }

    function dick {
        hw
        out "My name is Dick."
    }

    function harry {
        hw
        out "My name is Harry."
    }

    Private names can only include any characters apart from dollar (`$`).
    This is to prevent functions from overwriting variables (see the order of
    preference below).

    #### Undefining a private

    Because private functions are fixed to the source file that declares them,
    there isn't much point in undefining them. Thus at this point in time, it
    is not possible to do so.
