    `<>` (read pipe)
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Reads from a _murex_ named pipe
  Description: |-
    Sometimes you will need to start a commandline with a _murex_ named pipe:

    ```
    » <readpipe> -> match: foobar
    ```

    > See the documentation on `pipe` for more details about _murex_ named pipes.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <example> -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    The follow two examples function the same
    
    ```
    » pipe: example
    » bg { <example> -> match: 2 }
    » a: <example> [1..3]
    2
    » !pipe: example
    ```

  Title: >+
    `<stdin>` 
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Read the STDIN belonging to the parent code block
  Description: |-
    This is used inside functions and other code blocks to pass that block's
    STDIN down a pipeline
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    When writing more complex scripts, you cannot always invoke your read as the
    first command in a code block. For example a simple pipeline might be:

    ```
    » function: example { -> match: 2 }
    ```

    But this only works if `->` is the very first command. The following would
    fail:

    ```
    # Incorrect code
    function: example {
        out: "only match 2"
        -> match 2
    }
    ```

    This is where `<stdin>` comes to our rescue:

    ```
    function: example {
        out: "only match 2"
        <stdin> -> match 2
    }
    ```

    This could also be written as:

    ```
    function: example { out: "only match 2"; <stdin> -> match 2 }
    ```
