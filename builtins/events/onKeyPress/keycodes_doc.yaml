  Summary: >-
    Returns character sequences for any key pressed (ie sent from the terminal)
  Description: |-
    `key-code` is a tool used for querying what byte sequence the terminal emulator
  Usage: |-
    ```
    key-code -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> key-code -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Typical use case

    ```
    » key-code
    Press any key to print its escape constants...
    ```
    
    ...then press [f9] and `key-code` returns...

    ```
    ANSI Constants:   {F9}
    Byte Sequence:    %[27 91 50 48 126]
    Contains Unicode: false
    ```

    ### As a method

    ```
    » tout str '{ESC}[20~' -> key-code
    ANSI Constants:   {F9}

    ```

    ### Redirection

    If stdout is not a TTY then only the thing written is the ANSI Constant. This
    is so that it can be used as a variable. eg

    ```
    key-code -> set $key

    event onKeyPress close=$key {
        exit
    }
    ```
