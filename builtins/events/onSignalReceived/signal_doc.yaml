  Description: |-
    `signal` sends an operating system RPC (known as "signal") to a specified
    process, identified via it's process ID ("pid").

    ### Listing supported signals

    Signals will differ from one operating system to another. You can retrieve a
    JSON map with supported signals by running `signal` without any parameters.
  Usage: |-
    **Send a signal:**

    1. The first parameter is the process ID (int)
    2. The second parameter is the signal name (str). This will be all in
       UPPERCASE and prefixed "SIG"

    ```
    signal pid SIGNAL
    ```

    **List supported signals:**
    
    ```
    signal -> <stdout>
    ```

  Flags:
    SIGINT: >-
      **"Signal interrupt"** -- equivalent to pressing `ctrl`+`c`
    SIGQUIT: >-
      **"Signal quit"** -- requests the process quits and performs a core dump
    SIGTERM: >-
      **"Signal terminate"** -- request for a processes termination. Similar to `SIGINT`
    SIGUSR1: >-
      **"Signal user 1"** -- user defined
    SIGUSR2: >-
      **"Signal user 2"** -- user defined

    ### Catching incoming signals

    Signals can be caught (often referred to as "trapped") in Murex with an event:
    `signalTrap`. Read below for details.
