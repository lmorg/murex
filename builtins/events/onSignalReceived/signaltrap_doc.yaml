    `onSignalReceived`
  CategoryID: events
  Summary: >-
    Trap OS signals
  Description: |-
    `onSignalReceived` events are triggered by OS signals.

    {{ include "builtins/events/onSignalReceived/signals.inc.md" }}

    This event is designed to be used in shell scripts. While this event can be
    used with the shell in interactive mode (ie from the REPL prompt), this might
    result in unexpected behaviour. Thus it is only recommended to use
    `onSignalReceived` for shell scripts.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    event onSignalReceived name=SIGNAL { code block }

    !event onSignalReceived [SIGNAL]name
    ```
  Payload: |-
    The following payload is passed to the function via STDIN:

    ```
    {
        "Name": "",
        "Interrupt": {
            "Name": "",
            "Signal": ""
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Name

    This is the **namespaced** name -- ie the name and operation.

    ### Interrupt/Name

    This is the name you specified when defining the event.

    ### Signal

    This is the signal you specified when defining the event.

    Valid interrupt operation values are specified below. All interrupts / signals
    are UPPERCASE strings.

  Examples: |-
    **Interrupt 'SIGINT':**

    ```
    event onSignalReceived example=SIGINT {
        out "SIGINT received, not quitting"
    }
    ```

  Flags:
    SIGHUP: >-
      **"Signal hangup"** -- triggered when a controlling terminal is closed (eg the terminal emulator closed)
    SIGINT: >-
      **"Signal interrupt"** -- triggered when a user interrupts a process, typically via `ctrl`+`c`
    SIGQUIT: >-
      **"Signal quit"** -- when the user requests that the process quits and performs a core dump
    SIGTERM: >-
      **"Signal terminate"** -- triggered by a request for a processes termination. Similar to `SIGINT`
    SIGWINCH: >-
      **"Signal window change"** -- triggered when the TTY (eg terminal emulator) is resized
    SIGUSR1: >-
      **"Signal user 1"** -- user defined
    SIGUSR2: >-
      **"Signal user 2"** -- user defined

    ### Stdout

    Stdout is written to the terminal. So this can be used to provide multiple
    additional lines to the prompt since readline only supports one line for the
    prompt itself and three extra lines for the hint text.
  
    ### Order of execution

    Interrupts are run in alphabetical order. So an event named "alfa" would run
    before an event named "zulu". If you are writing multiple events and the order
    of execution matters, then you can prefix the names with a number, eg `10_jump`

    ### Namespacing

    The `onSignalReceived` event differs a little from other events when it comes
    to the namespacing of interrupts. Typically you cannot have multiple interrupts
    with the same name for an event. However with `onPrompt` their names are
    further namespaced by the interrupt name. In layman's terms this means
    `example=SIGINT` wouldn't overwrite `example=SIGQUIT`.
    
    The reason for this namespacing is because, unlike other events, you might
    legitimately want the same name for different interrupts.
