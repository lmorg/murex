# Builtins: `misc`

A few builtins for stuff that generally exists in most UNIX-like
environments. Included because it's quicker to run as a builtin rather
than creating a new PTY but offer fewer features than their GNU et al
counterparts. Frankly this package could be excluded from the shell
compilation if you find yourself tripping over their more limited
functionality when expecting GNU functions. However I've added these
functions for better compatibility with Windows systems.
