If you cannot process the\n> element on the first command then it is recommended you use the first\n> option (passing a variable) instead.\n\n## Detail\n\n### Preserving the data-type\n\n`foreach` will preserve the data-type read from STDIN in all instances where\ndata is being passed along the pipeline:\n\n* The temporary variable will be created with the same data-type as\n  `foreach`'s STDIN\n* The code block's STDIN will have the same data-type as `foreach`'s STDIN\n* `foreeach`'s STDOUT will also be the same data-type as it's STDIN\n\nThis last point means you may need to `cast` your data if you're writing\ndata in a different format. For example the following is creating a YAML list\nhowever the data-type is defined as `json`:\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" }\n    - 1\n    - 2\n    - 3\n    \n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" } -> debug -> [[ /Data-Type/Murex ]]\n    json\n    \nThus any marshalling or other data-type-aware API's would fail because they\nare expecting `json` and receiving an incompatible data format.\n\nThis can be resolved via `cast`:\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" } -> cast yaml\n    - 1\n    - 2\n    - 3\n    \n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" } -> cast yaml -> debug -> [[ /Data-Type/Murex ]]\n    yaml\n    \nThe output is the same but now it's defined as `yaml` so any further pipelined\nprocesses will now automatically use YAML marshallers when reading that data.\n\n### Tips when writing JSON inside for loops\n\nOne of the drawbacks (or maybe advantages, depending on your perspective) of\nJSON is that parsers generally expect a complete file for processing in that\nthe JSON specification requires closing tags for every opening tag. This means\nit's not always suitable for streaming. For example\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out ({ \"$i\": $i }) }\n    { \"1\": 1 }\n    { \"2\": 2 }\n    { \"3\": 3 }\n    \n**What does this even mean and how can you build a JSON file up sequentially?**\n\nOne answer if to write the output in a streaming file format and convert back\nto JSON\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out (- \"$i\": $i) }\n    - \"1\": 1\n    - \"2\": 2\n    - \"3\": 3\n    \n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out (- \"$i\": $i) } -> cast yaml -> format json\n    [\n        {\n            \"1\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"2\": 2\n        },\n        {\n            \"3\": 3\n        }\n    ]\n    \n**What if I'm returning an object rather than writing one?**\n\nThe problem with building JSON structures from existing structures is that you\ncan quickly end up with invalid JSON due to the specifications strict use of\ncommas.\n\n    » config -> [ shell ] -> formap k v { $v -> alter /Foo Bar }\n    {\n        \"Data-Type\": \"bool\",\n        \"Default\": true,\n        \"Description\": \"Display the interactive shell's hint text helper.
