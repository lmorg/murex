	Definition["foreach"] = "# `foreach` - Command Reference\n\n> Iterate through an array\n\n## Description\n\n`foreach` reads an array or map from STDIN and iterates through it, running\na code block for each iteration with the value of the iterated element passed\nto it.\n\nBy default `foreach`'s output data type is inherieted from its input data type.\nFor example is STDIN is `yaml` then so will STDOUT. The only exception to this\nis if STDIN is `json` in which case STDOUT will be jsonlines (`jsonl`), or when\nadditional flags are used such as `--jmap`.\n\n## Usage\n\n`{ code-block }` reads from a variable and writes to an array / unbuffered STDOUT:\n\n    <stdin> -> foreach variable { code-block } -> <stdout>\n    \n`{ code-block }` reads from STDIN and writes to an array / unbuffered STDOUT:\n\n    <stdin> -> foreach { -> code-block } -> <stdout>\n    \n`foreach` writes to a buffered JSON map:\n\n    <stdin> -> foreach --jmap variable { code-block (map key) } { code-block (map value) } -> <stdout>\n\n## Examples\n\nThere are two basic ways you can write a `foreach` loop depending on how you\nwant the iterated element passed to the code block.\n\nThe first option is to specify a temporary variable which can be read by the\ncode block:\n\n    » a [1..3] -> foreach i { out $i }\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    \n> Please note that the variable is specified **without** the dollar prefix,\n> then used in the code block **with** the dollar prefix.\n\nThe second option is for the code block's STDIN to read the element:\n\n    » a [1..3] -> foreach { -> cat }\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    \n> STDIN can only be read as the first command. If you cannot process the\n> element on the first command then it is recommended you use the first\n> option (passing a variable) instead.\n\n### Writing JSON maps\n\n    » ja [Monday..Friday] -> foreach --jmap day { out $day -> left 3 } { $day }\n    {\n        \"Fri\": \"Friday\",\n        \"Mon\": \"Monday\",\n        \"Thu\": \"Thursday\",\n        \"Tue\": \"Tuesday\",\n        \"Wed\": \"Wednesday\"\n    } \n\n## Flags\n\n* `--jmap`\n    Write a `json` map to STDOUT instead of an array\n\n## Detail\n\n### Preserving The Data Type (when no flags used)\n\n`foreach` will preserve the data type read from STDIN in all instances where\ndata is being passed along the pipeline and push that data type out at the\nother end:\n\n* The temporary variable will be created with the same data-type as\n  `foreach`'s STDIN, or the data type of the array element (eg if it is a\n  string or number)\n* The code block's STDIN will have the same data-type as `foreach`'s STDIN\n* `foreeach`'s STDOUT will also be the same data-type as it's STDIN (or `jsonl`\n  (jsonlines) where STDIN was `json` because `jsonl` better supports streaming)\n\nThis last point means you may need to `cast` your data if you're writing\ndata in a different format. For example the following is creating a YAML list\nhowever the data-type is defined as `json`:\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" }\n    - 1\n    - 2\n    - 3\n    \n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" } -> debug -> [[ /Data-Type/Murex ]]\n    json\n    \nThus any marshalling or other data-type-aware API's would fail because they\nare expecting `json` and receiving an incompatible data format.\n\nThis can be resolved via `cast`:\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" } -> cast yaml\n    - 1\n    - 2\n    - 3\n    \n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out \"- $i\" } -> cast yaml -> debug -> [[ /Data-Type/Murex ]]\n    yaml\n    \nThe output is the same but now it's defined as `yaml` so any further pipelined\nprocesses will now automatically use YAML marshallers when reading that data.\n\n### Tips when writing JSON inside for loops\n\nOne of the drawbacks (or maybe advantages, depending on your perspective) of\nJSON is that parsers generally expect a complete file for processing in that\nthe JSON specification requires closing tags for every opening tag. This means\nit's not always suitable for streaming. For example\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out ({ \"$i\": $i }) }\n    { \"1\": 1 }\n    { \"2\": 2 }\n    { \"3\": 3 }\n    \n**What does this even mean and how can you build a JSON file up sequentially?**\n\nOne answer if to write the output in a streaming file format and convert back\nto JSON\n\n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out (- \"$i\": $i) }\n    - \"1\": 1\n    - \"2\": 2\n    - \"3\": 3\n    \n    » ja [1..3] -> foreach i { out (- \"$i\": $i) } -> cast yaml -> format json\n    [\n        {\n            \"1\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"2\": 2\n        },\n        {\n            \"3\": 3\n        }\n    ]\n    \n**What if I'm returning an object rather than writing one?**\n\nThe problem with building JSON structures from existing structures is that you\ncan quickly end up with invalid JSON due to the specifications strict use of\ncommas.\n\nFor example in the code below, each item block is it's own object and there are\nno `[ ... ]` encapsulating them to denote it is an array of objects, nor are\nthe objects terminated by a comma.\n\n    » config -> [ shell ] -> formap k v { $v -> alter /Foo Bar }\n    {\n        \"Data-Type\": \"bool\",\n        \"Default\": true,\n        \"Description\": \"Display the interactive shell's hint text helper. Please note, even when this is disabled, it will still appear when used for regexp searches and other readline-specific functions\",\n        \"Dynamic\": false,\n        \"Foo\": \"Bar\",\n        \"Global\": true,\n        \"Value\": true\n    }\n    {\n        \"Data-Type\": \"block\",\n        \"Default\": \"{ progress $PID }\",\n        \"Description\": \"Murex function to execute when an `exec` process is stopped\",\n        \"Dynamic\": false,\n        \"Foo\": \"Bar\",\n        \"Global\": true,\n        \"Value\": \"{ progress $PID }\"\n    }\n    {\n        \"Data-Type\": \"bool\",\n        \"Default\": true,\n        \"Description\": \"ANSI escape sequences in Murex builtins to highlight syntax errors, history completions, {SGR} variables, etc\",\n        \"Dynamic\": false,\n        \"Foo\": \"Bar\",\n        \"Global\": true,\n        \"Value\": true\n    }\n    ...\n    \nLuckily JSON also has it's own streaming format: JSON lines (`jsonl`). We can\n`cast` this output as `jsonl` then `format` it back into valid JSON:\n\n    » config -> [ shell ] -> formap k v { $v -> alter /Foo Bar } -> cast jsonl -> format json\n    [\n        {\n            \"Data-Type\": \"bool\",\n            \"Default\": true,\n            \"Description\": \"Write shell history (interactive shell) to disk\",\n            \"Dynamic\": false,\n            \"Foo\": \"Bar\",\n            \"Global\": true,\n            \"Value\": true\n        },\n        {\n            \"Data-Type\": \"int\",\n            \"Default\": 4,\n            \"Description\": \"Maximum number of lines with auto-completion suggestions to display\",\n            \"Dynamic\": false,\n            \"Foo\": \"Bar\",\n            \"Global\": true,\n            \"Value\": \"6\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"Data-Type\": \"bool\",\n            \"Default\": true,\n            \"Description\": \"Display some status information about the stop process when ctrl+z is pressed (conceptually similar to ctrl+t / SIGINFO on some BSDs)\",\n            \"Dynamic\": false,\n            \"Foo\": \"Bar\",\n            \"Global\": true,\n            \"Value\": true\n        },\n    ...\n    \n#### `foreach` will automatically cast it's output as `jsonl` _if_ it's STDIN type is `json`\n\n    » ja: [Tom,Dick,Sally] -> foreach: name { out Hello $name }\n    Hello Tom\n    Hello Dick\n    Hello Sally\n    \n    » ja [Tom,Dick,Sally] -> foreach name { out Hello $name } -> debug -> [[ /Data-Type/Murex ]]\n    jsonl\n    \n    » ja: [Tom,Dick,Sally] -> foreach: name { out Hello $name } -> format: json\n    [\n        \"Hello Tom\",\n        \"Hello Dick\",\n        \"Hello Sally\"\n    ]\n\n## See Also\n\n* [`ReadArrayWithType()` (type)](../apis/ReadArrayWithType.md):\n  Read from a data type one array element at a time and return the elements contents and data type\n* [`[[` (element)](../commands/element.md):\n  Outputs an element from a nested structure\n* [`a` (mkarray)](../commands/a.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array or list\n* [`break`](../commands/break.md):\n  terminate execution of a block within your processes scope\n* [`cast`](../commands/cast.md):\n  Alters the data type of the previous function without altering it's output\n* [`debug`](../commands/debug.md):\n  Debugging information\n* [`for`](../commands/for.md):\n  A more familiar iteration loop to existing developers\n* [`formap`](../commands/formap.md):\n  Iterate through a map or other collection of data\n* [`format`](../commands/format.md):\n  Reformat one data-type into another data-type\n* [`if`](../commands/if.md):\n  Conditional statement to execute different blocks of code depending on the result of the condition\n* [`ja` (mkarray)](../commands/ja.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array\n* [`json` ](../types/json.md):\n  JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\n* [`jsonl` ](../types/jsonl.md):\n  JSON Lines\n* [`left`](../commands/left.md):\n  Left substring every item in a list\n* [`out`](../commands/out.md):\n  Print a string to the STDOUT with a trailing new line character\n* [`while`](../commands/while.md):\n  Loop until condition false\n* [`yaml` ](../types/yaml.md):\n  YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)"
