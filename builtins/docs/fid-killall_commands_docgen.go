You can obtain a FID from `fid-list`.\n\n## See Also\n\n* [commands/`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [commands/`exec`](../commands/exec.md):\n  Runs an executable\n* [commands/`fg`](../commands/fg.md):\n  Sends a background process into the foreground\n* [commands/`fid-kill`](../commands/fid-kill.md):\n  Terminate a running _murex_ function\n* [commands/`fid-list`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [commands/`murex-update-exe-list`](../commands/murex-update-exe-list.md):\n  Forces _murex_ to rescan $PATH looking for exectables\n* [commands/bexists](../commands/bexists.md):\n  \n* [commands/builtins](../commands/builtins.md):\n  \n* [commands/jobs](../commands/jobs.md):\n  "
