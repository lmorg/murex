	Definition["autoglob"] = "# `@g` (autoglob)  - Command Reference\n\n> Command prefix to expand globbing (deprecated)\n\n## Description\n\n**This feature is now deprecated and only applies to murex version 2:**\n\nBy default _murex_ does not expand globbing (`*` and `?` wildcards) instead\nencouraging the use of `g` (and similar) inside a subshell. While the aim of\nthis is to promote correctness, it can be a little annoying while working in\nthe interactive shell. For this reason you can prefix any command with `@g` to\nenable Bash-like globbing.\n\n## Usage\n\n    @g command ...\n\n## Examples\n\n    @g echo *\n\n## Detail\n\nAs of _murex_ `2.9` and above it is possible to enable automatic globbing in\nthe interactive shell without having to prefix the command with `@g` by\nenabling the following `config` option:\n\n    config: set shell auto-glob true\n    \nIt is enabled by default on from version 3.x onwards (and renamed to\n`expand-glob`)\n\n## See Also\n\n* [_murex_ Profile Files](../user-guide/profile.md):\n  A breakdown of the different files loaded on start up\n* [`config`](../commands/config.md):\n  Query or define _murex_ runtime settings\n* [`f`](../commands/f.md):\n  Lists or filters file system objects (eg files)\n* [`g`](../commands/g.md):\n  Glob pattern matching for file system objects (eg `*.txt`)\n* [`rx`](../commands/rx.md):\n  Regexp pattern matching for file system objects (eg `.*\\\\.txt`)"
