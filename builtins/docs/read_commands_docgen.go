However if no prompt\nstring is given then `read` will not write a prompt.\n\nThe last parameter will be the variable name to store the string read by `read`.\nThis variable cannot be prefixed by dollar, `$`, otherwise the shell will write\nthe output of that variable as the last parameter rather than the name of the\nvariable.\n\nThe data type the `read` line will be stored as is `str` (string). If you\nrequire this to be different then please use `tread` (typed read).\n\n### See Also\n\n* [commands/`(` (brace quote)](../commands/brace-quote.md):\n  Write a string to the STDOUT without new line\n* [commands/`>>` (append file)](../commands/greater-than-greater-than.md):\n  Writes STDIN to disk - appending contents if file already exists\n* [commands/`>` (truncate file)](../commands/greater-than.md):\n  Writes STDIN to disk - overwriting contents if file already exists\n* [commands/`cast`](../commands/cast.md):\n  Alters the data type of the previous function without altering it's output\n* [commands/`err`](../commands/err.md):\n  Print a line to the STDERR\n* [commands/`out`](../commands/out.md):\n  `echo` a string to the STDOUT with a trailing new line character\n* [commands/`tout`](../commands/tout.md):\n  Print a string to the STDOUT and set it's data-type\n* [commands/`tread`](../commands/tread.md):\n  `read` a line of input from the user and store as a user defined *typed* variable\n* [commands/sprintf](../commands/sprintf.md):\n  "
