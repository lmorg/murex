However if no prompt\nstring is given then `tread` will not write a prompt.\n\nThe last parameter will be the variable name to store the string read by `tread`.\nThis variable cannot be prefixed by dollar, `$`, otherwise the shell will write\nthe output of that variable as the last parameter rather than the name of the\nvariable.\n\n### See Also\n\n* [`(` (brace quote)](../commands/brace-quote.md):\n  Write a string to the STDOUT without new line\n* [`err`](../commands/err.md):\n  Print a line to the STDERR\n* [`out`](../commands/out.md):\n  `echo` a string to the STDOUT with a trailing new line character\n* [`read`](../commands/read.md):\n  `read` a line of input from the user and store as a variable\n* [`tout`](../commands/tout.md):\n  Print a string to the STDOUT and set it's data-type\n* [cast](../commands/cast.md):\n  \n* [format](../commands/format.md):\n  \n* [pretty](../commands/pretty.md):\n  \n* [sprintf](../commands/sprintf.md):\n  "
