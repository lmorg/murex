This means that you cannot use the\noperating systems default process viewer (eg `ps`) to list _murex_ functions.\nThis is where `fid-list` comes into play. It is used to view all the functions\nand processes that are managed by the current _murex_ session. That would\ninclude:\n* any aliases within _murex_\n* public and private _murex_ functions\n* builtins (eg `fid-list` is a builtin command)\n* any external processes that were launched from within this shell session\n* any background functions or processes of any of the above\n\n## Synonyms\n\n* `fid-list`\n* `jobs`\n\n\n## See Also\n\n* [commands/`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [commands/`exec`](../commands/exec.md):\n  Runs an executable\n* [commands/`fg`](../commands/fg.md):\n  Sends a background process into the foreground\n* [commands/`fid-kill`](../commands/fid-kill.md):\n  Terminate a running _murex_ function\n* [commands/`fid-killall`](../commands/fid-killall.md):\n  Terminate _all_ running _murex_ functions\n* [types/`jsonl` ](../types/jsonl.md):\n  JSON Lines (primitive)\n* [commands/`murex-update-exe-list`](../commands/murex-update-exe-list.md):\n  Forces _murex_ to rescan $PATH looking for exectables\n* [commands/bexists](../commands/bexists.md):\n  \n* [commands/builtins](../commands/builtins.md):\n  \n* [types/csv](../types/csv.md):\n  \n* [types/generic](../types/generic.md):\n  \n* [commands/jobs](../commands/jobs.md):\n  "
