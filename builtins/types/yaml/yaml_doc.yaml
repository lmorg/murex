    YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)
  Description: |-
    YAML support within _murex_ is pretty mature however it is not considered a
    primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
    expect in most deployments of _murex_, it's still an optional package and
    thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
    external source packages for the shell to compile.
  Usage:
  Examples:
  Hooks:
    ReadArray(): Works with YAML arrays. Maps are converted into arrays
    ReadArrayByType(): Works with YAML arrays. Maps are converted into arrays. Element type returned in _murex_ should match element type in YAML
    ReadMap(): Works with YAML maps
    WriteArray(): Works with YAML arrays
    ReadIndex(): Works against all properties in YAML
    ReadNotIndex(): Works against all properties in YAML
    Marshal(): Supported
    Unmarshal(): Supported
