  Summary: >-
    Structured array for working with `$PATH` style data
  Description: |-
    The `path` type Turns file and directory paths into structured objects.

    The root directory (typically `/`) is counted as a directory. If a path is
    relative rather than absolute then `/` will be excluded from outputted string.
  Usage:
  Examples: |-
    **Creating a PATH:**

    ```
    » %[/bin, /usr/bin, "$JAVA_HOME/bin"] -> format paths
    /bin:/usr/bin:/opt/java/bin
    ```

    **Splitting a PATH:**

    ```
    » $PATH -> :paths: format json
    [
        "/bin",
        "/usr/bin",
        "/opt/java/bin"
    ]
    ```

    **Appending to `$PATH`:**

    ```
    » $PATH -> :paths: append /sbin -> export PATH
    » $PATH
    /bin:/usr/bin:/opt/java/bin:/sbin
    ```
