    JSON Lines (primitive)
  Description: |-
    The following description is taken from [jsonlines.org](http://jsonlines.org/):

    > JSON Lines is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be
    > processed one record at a time. It works well with unix-style text
    > processing tools and shell pipelines. It's a great format for log files.
    > It's also a flexible format for passing messages between cooperating
    > processes.

    ### Tabulated data

    ```
    ["Name", "Session", "Score", "Completed"]
    ["Gilbert", "2013", 24, true]
    ["Alexa", "2013", 29, true]
    ["May", "2012B", 14, false]
    ["Deloise", "2012A", 19, true] 
    ```

    This format is equatable to `generic` and `csv`.
    
    ### Nested objects
    
    ```
    {"name": "Gilbert", "wins": [["straight", "7♣"], ["one pair", "10♥"]]}
    {"name": "Alexa", "wins": [["two pair", "4♠"], ["two pair", "9♠"]]}
    {"name": "May", "wins": []}
    {"name": "Deloise", "wins": [["three of a kind", "5♣"]]}
    ```
  Hooks:
    ReadArray(): Works with JSON arrays. Maps are converted into arrays
    ReadMap(): Not currently supported.
    WriteArray(): Supported
    ReadIndex(): Works against all properties in JSON
    ReadNotIndex(): Works against all properties in JSON
    Marshal(): Supported
    Unmarshal(): Supported

    ### Concatenated JSON

    Technically the `jsonl` Unmarshal() method supports Concatenated JSON, as
    described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Concatenated_JSON):

    > Concatenated JSON streaming allows the sender to simply write each JSON
    > object into the stream with no delimiters. It relies on the receiver using
    > a parser that can recognize and emit each JSON object as the terminating
    > character is parsed. Concatenated JSON isn't a new format, it's simply a
    > name for streaming multiple JSON objects without any delimiters.
    >
    > The advantage of this format is that it can handle JSON objects that have
    > been formatted with embedded newline characters, e.g., pretty-printed for
    > human readability. For example, these two inputs are both valid and produce
    > the same output:
    >
    > #### Single line concatenated JSON
    >
    >     {"some":"thing\n"}{"may":{"include":"nested","objects":["and","arrays"]}}
    >
    > #### Multi-line concatenated JSON
    >
    >     {
    >       "some": "thing\n"
    >     }
    >     {
    >       "may": {
    >         "include": "nested",
    >         "objects": [
    >           "and",
    >           "arrays"
    >         ]
    >       }
    >     }

    ...however in _murex_'s case, only single line concatenated JSON files
    (example 1) are supported; and that is only supported to cover some edge
    cases when writing JSON lines and a new line character isn't included. The
    primary example might be when generating JSON lines from inside a `for` loop.

    This behavior is also described on GitHub in [issue #141](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/141).

    ### More information

    This format is sometimes also referred to as LDJSON and NDJSON, as described
    on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON).

    _murex_'s [`json` data-type document](json.md) also describes some use
    cases for JSON lines.
