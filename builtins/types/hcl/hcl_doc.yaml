    HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)
  Description: |-
    The description below is taken from the HCL git repository's [README](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl):
    
    > HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built by
    > HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language
    > that is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but
    > specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.
    >
    > HCL is also fully JSON compatible. That is, JSON can be used as completely
    > valid input to a system expecting HCL. This helps makes systems interoperable
    > with other systems.

    HCL support within _murex_ is pretty mature however it is not considered a
    primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
    expect in most deployments of _murex_, it's still an optional package and
    thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
    external source packages for the shell to compile.
  Usage: |-
  Examples: |-
    ```
    terraform {
      required_version = "~> 0.11.5"
    }

    data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

    data "aws_vpc" "vpc" {
      id = "${var.vpc_id}"
    }

    data "aws_route53_zone" "external" {
      zone_id = "${var.external_hosted_zone_id}"
    }

    data "aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role_policy" {
      statement {
        actions = ["sts:AssumeRole"]
        effect  = "Allow"

        principals {
          identifiers = ["ec2.amazonaws.com"]
          type        = "Service"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    See the HashiCorp's [documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl) for HCL syntax.
  Hooks:
    ReadArray(): Works with HCL arrays. Maps are converted into arrays
    ReadArrayWithType(): Works with HCL arrays. Maps are converted into arrays. Elements data-type in _murex_ mirrors the HCL type of the element
    ReadMap(): Works with HCL maps
    WriteArray(): Works with HCL arrays
    ReadIndex(): Works against all properties in HCL
    ReadNotIndex(): Works against all properties in HCL
    Marshal(): Supported via a JSON marshaller because HCL is designed to be written by humans but "compiled" into JSON
    Unmarshal(): Supported
