    Apache httpd "common" log format
  Description: |-
    Apache httpd supports a few different log formats. This Murex type is for
    parsing the "common" log format.
  Usage: |-
  Examples: |-
  Hooks:
    ReadArray(): Supported. Each line is considered an index (like with `str` data type)
    ReadArrayWithType(): Supported. Each line is considered an index with `commonlog` data type
    ReadMap(): Not supported, currently a work in progress
    ReadIndex(): Entire log file is read and then the indexes are derived from there
    ReadNotIndex(): Entire log file is read and then the indexes are derived from there
    Marshal(): Supported though no unmarshalling is currently supported
  Detail: |-
    The code here is very rudimentary. If you have large log files or need more complex
    data querying then this data-type is probably not the right tool. Maybe try one of
    the following:

    * [Firesword](https://github.com/lmorg/firesword) - for command line analysis
    * [Plasmasword](https://github.com/lmorg/plasmasword) - exports fields to an sqlite3 or mysql database
