    Whole number (primitive)
  Description: |-
    An integer is a whole number (eg 1, 2, 3, 4) rather than one with a decimal
    point (such as 1.1).

    Integers in Murex are sized based on the bit (or word) size of the target
    CPU.
    
    A 386, ARMv6 or other 32bit build of Murex would see the range of from
    `-2147483648` (negative) through `2147483647` (positive).

    AMD64 or other 64bit built of Murex would see the range from
    `-9223372036854775808` (negative) through `9223372036854775807` (positive).

    > Unless you specifically know you only want whole numbers, it is recommended
    > that you use the default numeric data-type: `num`.

    numbers.
