    Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language (TOML)
  Description: |-
    TOML support within _murex_ is pretty mature however it is not considered a
    primitive. Which means, while it is a recommended builtin which you should
    expect in most deployments of _murex_, it's still an optional package and
    thus may not be present in some edge cases. This is because it relies on
    external source packages for the shell to compile.
